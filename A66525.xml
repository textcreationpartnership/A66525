            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is a New <hi>Treatiſe</hi> come forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> the Deſign where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to prove the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and to diſprove that of <hi>Infants.</hi> There is great Cracking about it, and ſome cry it up for a <hi>None-ſuch;</hi> that it is unanſwerable, and as I hear the Author himſelf, <hi>Ixion</hi>-like, falls in love with his own ſhadow, and being <hi>Philautia nimis inflatus,</hi> puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with the excellency of his performance, glories much, and pretends that he hath not only proſelyted many of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſort, but ſome alſo of the <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> And it is very certain, that at its firſt appearance laſt Summer, divers perſons were <hi>Dipped</hi> in theſe parts, and as I have been informed, 7 or 8 in a day in the City of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol;</hi> and in all likelyhood we may hear of many more this Summer: for thoſe who are inclinable to the Way, are now grown ſo politick as not to profeſs their Faith till warm Weather. This I do aſſure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that the Book (as to any thing material in it) hath been many times anſwered before ever it came forth, and that's the reaſon belike we have heard of no Reply ſince it hath ſeen the light, which is now about twelve Months. All the <hi>Mediums</hi> he uſeth to maintain his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, are ſuch trite and out-worn things, that they have been in effect trampled upon, and confuted again and again. Nevertheleſs ſuch is the <hi>Clamorouſneſs</hi> of ſome men, that they affect to have the laſt word, when in
<pb facs="tcp:57924:3"/>modeſty they ought to be ſilent, and conſider, that it is their duty to unlearn a darling Errour, and no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to ſtrike ſail to convincing Reaſon. Great Endeavours have been uſed to undeceive the <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> and 'tis the unhappineſs of many Godly and Learned Divines, inſtead of meeting with anſwerable ſucceſs, to have their Pains contemned, and their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons loaded with Aſperſions. The <hi>Author</hi> of the Treatiſe I am to examine, hath only affixt <hi>H. D.</hi> to the Title-page, that is, as appears by a Second Edition lately come forth. <hi>Henry Danvers;</hi> although in regard of the principal Materials, the Book hath more reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>J. T.</hi> that is, <hi>John Tombes,</hi> for its <hi>Author.</hi> For although <hi>H D.</hi> hath for ſome years lived a ſolitary contemplative Life, and hath had opportunity for ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet owneth he not ſo much Scholarſhip (if they ſay true that know him) as to compoſe ſuch a Piece; nor is he ſo well acquainted with Fathers, Councils, Schoolmen, had not moſt of it been prepared to his hand. Indeed I find he is ſomewhat vers'd in the Magdiburgenſian Hiſtory, though he hath made very ill uſe of it; But for the Argumentative part, eſpecially the Oppoſition made againſt Infant-Baptiſm, both the Method and Matter of his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> declares where he hath been fiſhing; for I find very little in it, beſides what is borrowed from Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Exercitation</hi> and <hi>Examen,</hi> long ſince anſwered by M. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerce,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> But foraſmuch as the Conteſt hath taken a Nap for about 20 years, it was thought fit to give it one luſty jog more, and awaken it again. And in regard thoſe Polemical Diſcourſes are rarely found in Vulgar hands, but are thrown aſide into Corners, and lie ſolitary, as neglected things, in Studies, and Bookſellers Shops; the <hi>Author,</hi> and his Coniederates (out of their dear love to their <hi>Darling</hi> Opinion) thought meet to make ſome good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the late Liberty granted by his Majeſty's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Declaration,</hi> and to take up the <hi>Gantlet</hi> again, and fall to the old Trade of <hi>Wrangling.</hi> For ſome men are of a reſtleſs Spirit, and if their <hi>Hands</hi> be tied up from fighting, they will do it with their <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Pens.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57924:3"/>The <hi>Preface</hi> is made up of <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Infant Baptiſm, but moſtly againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> by reaſon of ſome Paſſages of his in a late Book called <hi>The Chriſtian Directory,</hi> againſt which he ſeems to have a very great zeal, but I fear his envy againſt his Perſon doth exceed it. For do but compare the <hi>Preface,</hi> with the <hi>Epilogue</hi> of our <hi>Authors Treatiſe,,</hi> and you will find he ſeems to entertain a better opinion of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> then of him. I underſtand Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will ſpeedily write ſomething for his own Vindication, and I long to ſee it, that ſo nothing that he hath ſaid in his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Directory may prove a Stumbling-block to the Weak, and more confirm the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> in their Errour. The truth is, thoſe people are very ſenſible how much he hath wounded their Cauſe, and are glad with an occaſion of wounding his Reputation. But I profeſs, I could not but ſmile, to obſerve how he ſeems to bewail the Indiſcretion of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes him for Printing his Judgement in ſome Points that refer to Baptiſm, and other things, at ſuch an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time; as if he had hit upon the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the fitteſt opportunity to declaim againſt Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But doth he take this to be a fit time of the day (to uſe his own Phraſe) to widen Differences, and ſet us at farther diſtances, when we are almoſt ſinking under fears and daily expectations of troubles? Is it a fit ſeaſon for us to be <hi>wrangling,</hi> when Gods Rod is ſhaking over all our Heads? Muſt he at ſuch a time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the old Obfolete Controverſie, and inveigh againſt Childrens Baptiſm, which evermore hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned heart-burnings and fruitleſs contendings, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when 'tis diſputed againſt with a lofty, bitter and diſdainful Spirit, of which we perceive too much in this laſt attempt. Ah! what a reſtleſs <hi>Genius</hi> is there attending ſome Opinions, and how careleſs of the Churches <hi>Peace</hi> are the Abettors of them? What the Author himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>pag.</hi> 308. from <hi>Clopenburg's Epiſtle,</hi> of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> heretofore in <hi>Germany</hi> is too true of ſome of thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>That they ſuffer not the pure Reformed Churches to be edified without daily conflicts.</hi> For not only heretofore in times of Liberty, but even now
<pb facs="tcp:57924:4"/>under reſtraint, ſome hot-ſpirited Perſons, publiſh their Tenents, with ſuch a rigid and condemning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that it proves the greateſt hinderance of Union and Conjunction amongſt us in this Nation. The Opinion of <hi>Antipaedobaptiſm,</hi> having been (as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) always <hi>Ominous,</hi> and of a wonderous ſtrange influence to deſtroy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and Peace amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, accompanied alſo with the moſt Retinue of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> ſince the firſt <hi>Embrio</hi> of it was brought forth; Whether by a ſecret Judgement of God, or from the natural and ſecret Connexion with other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Darkneſs, I will not, ſaith he, determine: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath ſhewed ſome black <hi>Characters</hi> of it in every Nation where it hath prevailed; though we cannot but ſay many Saints are under the power of it. Yea, and I do alſo farther atteſt, that there are ſome very worthy Perſons, and eminent Chriſtians of that way, whom I exceedingly honour for their Gifts and Graces, Moderation and ſweetneſs of Spirit, and Liberality towards all Chriſtians; ſuch as theſe I prize as much as any Chriſtians in <hi>England</hi> that are <hi>Paedobaptiſts,</hi> and could as willingly imbrace them and entertain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Fellowſhip with them, as with any that are of my own Judgement in the point of Baptiſm. We ought to put a difference between humble and heady Men, between factious Perſons that affect Singularity, and decline Communion with us, becauſe we differ from them in ſome Circumſtances about an External Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; and ſuch as diſown Infant-baptiſm out of ſimple Perſwaſion, looking on it as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and without Scripture ground,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Gerce Vind. Paedobaptiſmi.</note> and ſo cannot ſubmit unto it, leſt thereby they defile their Conſciences (as they conceive) with <hi>Will-worſhip:</hi> when notwithſtanding, if other Chriſtians be of another mind, they can own them as Brethren, and not divide in regard of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Affection and Communion. Some ſuch there are, though few: and ſuch a frame of ſpirit was there in that Man of God (Mr. <hi>Jeſſey</hi>) as may be ſeen in his Book intituled <hi>A Store-houſe of Proviſion in ſundry Caſes of Conſcience.</hi> He, to my knowledge, was an <hi>Antipae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57924:4"/>of long ſtanding, as holy, I conceive, as any of that Judgement, of good Learning, and of a very tender Conſcience, and of ſo healing and uniting a Spirit, that he eſteemed it his Duty (and preſs'd others to it) to keep up Chriſtian Communion with thoſe that feared God though they differed about Baptiſm: We have his Arguments for the ſame publiſhed in Print, and grounded upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. which are ſo clear, and have in them ſuch ſtrength of Evidence, that I never yet could hear them anſwered, nor do ever expect it. I wiſh there were more ſuch <hi>Antipaedobaptis</hi> as he, and have good ground to believe many of them would come off from their Rigidneſs (were they not afraid of offending their weak Brethren, and fettered with ſome engagements at firſt entrance into their Churches) and would readily afford us the right hand of Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I know what a dangerous thing it is to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> and whence that Spirit comes, and can appeal to Heaven that I now appear in the defence of what I conceive to be the Truth, without a malevolent mind againſt any of our Diſſenters. I have had an intimate and friendly Correſpondency with many <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> both in this place where I now inhabit and elſewhere; by reaſon of which ſome have thought I comported with them in their Opinions: But this is a miſtake: I own what I ſee of God in them, and in all Profeſſors of Religion whatſoever, and would have none to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs Religion to themſelves. And if I know my own heart, where ever I ſee <hi>aliquid Chriſti, any thing of Chriſt,</hi> it attracts my Affection; God's People being all alike equally dear to me, as they are his, and have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation becoming the Goſpel. My Love is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a Party, but extenſive to all Saints. And though ſome may count me an enemy for telling them the truth, and withdraw their Affection, it is no more than I expect, and ſhall encourage my ſelf with what I long ſince learned from a Heathen, <hi>viz. Amicus</hi> Plato, <hi>amicus</hi> Socrates; <hi>ſed magis amica Veritas.</hi> I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee how likely I am to purchaſe the diſpleaſure and diſpraiſe of thoſe that cannot endure to have their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb facs="tcp:57924:5"/>ſpoken againſt; at which I hope to be no more <hi>dejected,</hi> than <hi>elated,</hi> if others ſhall own my poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance under the Notion of <hi>Approbation:</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all <hi>Polemical</hi> and Controverſial Diſcourſes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a face like that of a <hi>Picture,</hi> ſuitable to the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and light the Beholders ſtand in, or are guided by.</p>
            <p>Nor do I ſo much as hope to reduce any of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites: for the men of their Way are inflexible, and ſeem to be as much aſſured the Truth is on their ſide, as they are of the divine Athority of the Scriptures. I have heard of ſome Quakers that have been turned, but could never yet hear of one of them that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Opinion, unleſs he happened to fall into ſome worſe Errour.</p>
            <p>And certainly it is a ſtrange Preſumption, no leſs <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian</hi> than <hi>Prodigious,</hi> for men to aſſume a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of judging thoſe to be in the dark (as is the common humour of our Oppoſites) that differ from them in this point of Baptiſm, when they cannot but confeſs, that in other things they are of more clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Intellectuals than themſelves, and have a deeper inſpection into Scripture: And yet their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings</hi> at leaſt muſt be condemned, whilſt they impoſe the <hi>ſcanty</hi> Meaſure of their <hi>own,</hi> as an unqueſtionable <hi>Standard,</hi> for others to ſubmit to. Forgetting in the mean while, that many who were of their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have (at the long run) eſpouſed ſome groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and renounced <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> as a low, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Ceremony, and owned no other Baptiſm but that of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> It was long ſince obſerved that ſome of the hotteſt <hi>Zealots</hi> againſt Infant-baptiſm, have grown ſo cold, as to turn <hi>Seekers,</hi> and to deny the lawful Adminiſtration of Ordinances. So common is it for men to run from one Extreme to another.</p>
            <p>But though I deſpair of gaining over to us any of thoſe who are ſo rivetted in their Opinions (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal how ſucceſleſs politer Pens have been) yet do I hope, by what ſhall follow, to put ſome <hi>Remora</hi> and ſtop to weak and wavering Souls, that they be not over-haſty in coming over to the Tents of our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites:
<pb facs="tcp:57924:5"/>and to eſtabliſh and confirm others that are at preſent ſatisfied in the practice of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>And becauſe ſome of both Parties may take offence at what I have done; for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is difficult, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to pleaſe all, I am obliged to ſignifie ſome Reaſons amongſt others that moved me to enter the Liſts of a publick Diſpute.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Pompous Treatiſe of my Antagoniſt being put into my hand, by one of his Judgment, and cried up for an incomparable and unanſwerable Piece. I read ſome part of it curſorily, and confeſs I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muzed at the Multitude of Quotations, from <hi>Fathers, Councils,</hi> ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church, <hi>School-men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Modern</hi> Writers; together with the Teſtimonies of <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and Old <hi>Britains;</hi> and all againſt Infant-baptiſm, and being ſhortly after upon ſome occaſion at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I took the opportunity to examine his Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Publick Library, and upon ſearching found it ſo fallacious a Piece, that I thought my ſelf bound in Conſcience, for the honour of <hi>Truth,</hi> and Love to my <hi>Country,</hi> to make diſcovery thereof, that the Credulity of illiterate and well-meaning Perſons might not be impoſed upon by ſuch Forgery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have been ſomewhat provoked to bear Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Lawfulneſs of Baptizing the Children of Believers, by the <hi>Audacity</hi> of one, that ſometimes preacheth amongſt the Antipedobaptiſts who told me to my Face, that I could ſay nothing for Infant Baptiſm, to whom I ſaid but little, as judging him uncapable of underſtanding the ſtrength of an Argument.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After I had communicated a few Sheets to ſome Learned Men, they did <hi>album calculum addere,</hi> and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to proceed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe no body elſe had publiſhed any thing to confront this daring Champion; and I ſee no cauſe to repent of my Undertaking, unleſs it be that I have not defended the Truth as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>I was never before engaged in theſe <hi>Olympian</hi> Games, nor do I delight in ſuch Exerciſes, and do find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb facs="tcp:57924:6"/>that theſe Polemical Conteſts are but barren things, and cannot but much approve of the Saying of <hi>Zuarez,</hi> who (though a <hi>Jeſuite</hi>) profeſſed he found more benefit in that time which he did every day ſet apart for the examining the State of his Soul, than in all the Voluminous Books of Controverſies which he had written.</p>
            <p>I would now advertiſe the Reader, that my Anſwer refers to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Firſt Book, it being in the Preſs before his 2d. <hi>Edition</hi> came to hand; in which I find no Retracting or Rectifying Miſtakes, but in ſtead thereof a numerous Addition of more: ſome of which, I have taken notice of in the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of the <hi>Magdeburgenſian</hi> Hiſtory, concerning Infant Baptiſm, affixt to my Anſwer.</p>
            <p>There are many egregious Faults I charge Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> with, which are made good in the Anſwer. For I quote the Chapter and Page of the Authors that he abuſeth; that ſo thoſe who are Scholars, if they pleaſe, may ſee whether I wrong him. The Books are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and we have no <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to relieve him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath much injured that famous Hiſtory of the <hi>Magdiburgenſes</hi> in very many places, by miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ſay; as that they tell us that in the firſt <hi>Century,</hi> the Apoſtles baptized <hi>Only</hi> the Aged, which is falſe; for he hath himſelf added the Word <hi>[Only]</hi> as is ſhewn <hi>Capt.</hi> 7. <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 2. of our <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Then he ſaith they tell us that the Cuſtom of <hi>Dipping</hi> the whole Body into water was changed into Sprinkling in the 3. <hi>Cent.</hi> See this pag. 113. and cites the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgenſes</hi> for it, <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 125, 126. where they ſay no ſuch thing, but the contrary, and gives <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it (who is calculated to live in the days of thoſe that ſaw the Apoſtles) that Baptiſm is valid whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by Immerſion or Sprinkling <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of the <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Look the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Magdiburgenſiam</hi> Hiſtory and there you have the reſt of his Miſrepreſentations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After the ſame manner hath he ſerv'd the Fathers both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latino</hi> Churches; Quoting ſome
<pb facs="tcp:57924:6"/>Paſſages out of them as if they had been for Believers Baptiſm, in oppoſition to that of Infants, when not one of them was ſo, no not <hi>Tertullian</hi> or <hi>Nazianzen</hi> abſolutely, but both for it in caſe of danger of death; yea, the latter without reſpect to that. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 13. of the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and the 3. <hi>Century</hi> in the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> at the end of the <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be two ways he takes to blind the Reader with reſpect to the Fathers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Traducing that which is ſpoken in reference to <hi>Pagans,</hi> and miſapplying of it againſt Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: thus he ſerves <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Auſtin, p.</hi> 76. of his <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> whom he brings for his eminent Witneſſes for Believers Baptiſm; and then again the ſame men to be for Infant Baptiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 121. of his <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> See how this Contradiction is reconciled in our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to his 2d. <hi>Chap. part.</hi> 2. About Infants Baptiſm. 2. By curtailing and leaving out part of the Sentence, as <hi>pag.</hi> 65. where he cites theſe words of <hi>Bazil; Muſt the faithful be ſealed with Baptiſm?— Faith muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and go before.</hi> There Mr <hi>Danvers</hi> ſtops whereas he ſhould have gone on with what follows, <hi>Quid de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantibus ais?—num &amp; illos baptizemus? Maximè</hi> — Theſe are the next Lines to what we have above. —<hi>What ſay you to Infants which know nor good nor evil, muſt we baptize them? Yea,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 13. of the <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Councils have no better meaſure from him; for he quotes thoſe 3. the <hi>Bracaren,</hi> that of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> (he writes it <hi>Conſtance</hi>) and that of <hi>Toletan.</hi> All which, he produceth for Believers Baptiſm in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of Infants, <hi>p.</hi> 78. of his <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and quotes the <hi>Magdiburgenſes</hi> for it, <hi>Cent.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 146. Whereas they give us to underſtand that they were for Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 1 <hi>pag.</hi> 29, 30. of our <hi>Anſwer.</hi> See this more fully in the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> affixt to the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> under <hi>Century</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He brings in the Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church very ridiculouſly, as eminent Witneſſes for Believers baptiſm, that is, in oppoſition to Infant Baptiſm, or elſe he ſays nothing; As for Inſtance, <hi>Haimo, Rabanus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57924:7"/>an <hi>Abbot, Remigius</hi> a <hi>Monk, Smarugdus, &amp;c.</hi> See how little truth there is in this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 33. of the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and much more fully in the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> at the end of the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> under <hi>Century</hi> 8, 9, 10. Here our <hi>Author</hi> hath uſed his wonted ſubtilty in quoting ſome paſſages out of theſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctors for Believers Baptiſm, meant by them only in reſpect of Pagans.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By the ſame Artifice are ignorant perſons deluded with the ſayings of the Schoolmen, which were ſo great and ſtiff aſſertors of Infant-baptiſm, that they aſcrib'd too much to it. See how we have diſcovered the Authors Sophiſtry, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 34. of our <hi>Anſwer:</hi> But more fully this is ſpoken to, in the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> under the 12th <hi>Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. His great Witneſſes againſt Infant-baptiſm, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Waldenſes, Novatians,</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Ancient Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> fail him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> he hath brought 4 Confeſſions, as againſt it, when they have not a word of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as any ordinary Reader may perceive. See <hi>pag.</hi> 282, 283. of his <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> and how fully we have made it appear by other Confeſſions that they were expreſly for it: See <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>part.</hi> 2. of the <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither were the <hi>Novatians</hi> for it, though they denyed Original Sin, and were for Rebaptization of ſuch as were baptized by Hereticks (though there were few greater than themſelves;) and therefore <hi>Novatus</hi> the Head of them was condemned by 66. <hi>wiſhops,</hi> in the year 255. <hi>Fox, Act. Monum. vol.</hi> 1. So the <hi>Magdiburgenſes</hi> ſpeak of his being condemned by a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> for his Hereſies, <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 193. They write of his Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and among others, that he did <hi>de Deo prophaniſſimam doctrinam ſubintroducere, introduce moſt prophane Doctrines concerning God;</hi> but not a word of his denying Infant Baptiſm, <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 99. <hi>De Haereſs Novatiorum.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Danaeus,</hi> in <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Catalogue of Hereſies, make mention of any ſuch thing, <hi>Danaei Opuſc. p.</hi> 678.</p>
            <p>Nor did the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> deny Infant Baptiſm, as appears from the <hi>Magdiburgs, Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 375. <hi>De Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarum haerefi;</hi> though they were for Rebaptization of ſuch as were baptized by Hereticks, yet there is not the
<pb facs="tcp:57924:7"/>leaſt hint of their being againſt Infant-baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> were not againſt it; and the Miſtake of the Author is grounded upon <hi>Fabian</hi>'s para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtical Tranſlation of <hi>Bede,</hi> as is ſhewn in our Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. He hath manifeſt Contradictions to himſelf; firſt ſhewing ſuch perſons to be for Believers Baptiſm, and then afterward citing the ſame men for Infant-baptiſm: thus we have him mentioning <hi>Bede Pro</hi> and <hi>Con p.</hi> 7. and <hi>p.</hi> 78. of the firſt part of of his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> compared with <hi>p.</hi> 130. Thus he ſerv'd <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> as was noted before. And ſo he leaves them to claſh, and his Reader, in the dark; whereas the Diſtinction of <hi>Eccleſia Collecta</hi> and <hi>Colligenda</hi> would reconcile all very well. In the ſame manner hath he dealt with many of our Modern Divines, as <hi>Calvin, Piſcator, Perkins, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus, &amp;c.</hi> as we have ſhewn <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. of the <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Notorious <hi>Plagiariſm;</hi> for I have noted him bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing from Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his 2 Books, <hi>Exercitation</hi> and <hi>Examen</hi> in no leſs than 49 places, and all the while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his Name, contrary to the Laws of Ingenuity. But that which is moſt prodigious, and for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to carry away the Bell from all Plagiaries, is (as we have noted, <hi>p.</hi> 154. of the 2. Part. of our <hi>Anſwer</hi> Chap. 2. beginning at his Exceptions againſt our Argument from Federal Holineſs) that for 43 pages together he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Subſtance of it all out of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Examen,</hi> excepting what he quotes from Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi> And I muſt acquaint thee, Reader, that he hath ſerv'd others in the ſame manner, tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing out of their Books very la6rgely, without taking the leaſt notice of their names: for I have met lately with a <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> ſince part of my Anſwer was printed; one Book put out by <hi>William Allen</hi> called <hi>Some Baptiſmal Abuſes newly diſcovered,</hi> and the other by <hi>Henry Haggar,</hi> named <hi>The Foundation of the Font:</hi> but I muſt ſpare him for the preſent, or my Preface will be too large. I ſee if every Bird had his own Feathers, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would be left naked.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Shameful <hi>Oſcitancy,</hi> ſuch I think as the like was
<pb facs="tcp:57924:8"/>never known: We have it <hi>p.</hi> 209. of his Treatiſe, where he brings <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. interpreting the Seed to whom the Promiſe was made, to be the Spiritual, and not Carnal; when he ſpeaks no ſuch word, but all along to the contrary; as, <hi>Clara eſt</hi> Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li <hi>doctrina de naturalibus</hi> Abrahae <hi>filiis — St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s doctrine,</hi> Rom. 11.16. <hi>is evidently to be understood of the Natural ſons of</hi> Abraham: and again; <hi>Nihil certius eſt, quàm Deus foedus ſuum paciſci cum filiis</hi> Abrahae, <hi>qui naturaliter ex eo gignendi, Nothing is more sertain, than that God's Covenant was made with the Natural Off-ſpring of</hi> Abraham. And indeed the words which he fathers upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> are <hi>Estius</hi> the Jeſuite's, ſpoken againſt the Interpretation of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> I have ſhewed how Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> came to be guilty of the miſtake, <hi>pag.</hi> 196. of the 2d part of my <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. He doth vilifie and contemn all that ſtand in his way, Epiſcoparians, Presbyterians and Independents, yea fearfully reproaching thoſe who are <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> that are come off from their former Rigidneſs, and for a large Communion with all Believers as Believers. As appears by his dealing with Mr. <hi>Bunion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> in his <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi>

            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe <hi>Piacula,</hi> and more that may be named, the Credulous Party will believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the ſuppoſed Incomparable and moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Piece of Mr. <hi>Danvers:</hi> I muſt prepare for their Cenſures, and begin to hear already the inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſome of them over me, that I ſhould dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to encounter ſuch a <hi>Goliah;</hi> they are many of them illiterate, and incapable of examining the things written in the Latin Tongue, and it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould believe me before ſuch an <hi>Anteſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> But ſince it cannot be remedied, I ſhall leave them to their <hi>Credulity,</hi> to be edified by his <hi>Melody.</hi> I know the Learned, upon ſearch; will acquit me from <hi>Slander,</hi> and for the reſt I am of <hi>Austin</hi>'s Mind, <hi>Non curo Ceuſores, qui vel non intelligendo reprehendunt, vel reprehendendo non intelligunt.</hi> Reader, I have only two things more to adviſe thee of.</p>

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough thou art entertained with theſe Contoverſies, which are unpleaſing to many good and peaceable men, it muſt be conſidered, <hi>1.</hi> How far they are <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; 2.</hi> And <hi>who makes</hi> them ſo. This kind of work is more coſtly and bitter to peaceable Authors that are forced to it, than it is to the Readers. And it's pity that the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould, for <hi>1500</hi> years be taken up ſo much with a work that is ſo unpleaſant to almoſt all. It is unpleaſant to the Adverſary, to have his Ignorance, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Falſhoods and Injuries to the Truth and Church, made known to his diſgrace; and to have that proved an odious Error which he taketh to be a Beam from Heaven, and of a Divine Off-ſpring, and perhaps neceſſary to Salvation, or at leaſt ſome excellent thing which the Church cannot ſpare. It is unpleaſant to the ſober pious Writer, to think that he muſt thus diſpleaſe and exaſperate his Brother, and all that are of the way which he oppugneth: and that thereby he muſt provoke ſo many to eſteem and defame him as an enemy to the Truth. And it is not pleaſant to think, what hard ſtudy and labour it muſt coſt us to procure this bitter fruit, when by Ignorance, Sloth or treacherous Silence, we could have kept our peace, and ſuch mens Love. And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
<pb facs="tcp:57924:9"/>to the beſt of Readers, to find mens Minds thus manifeſting their diſſenſions, and to think of the Exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and wrath that will enſue, and to ſee ſuch Wars kept up among thoſe who ſhould be notified to the World by an Eminency of Love: But it will be pleaſant to thoſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, whoſe Religion conſiſteth in <hi>Opinions, Parties</hi> and <hi>Diſputes,</hi> if they be of his mind whoſe Works they read; and it will be <hi>bitterſweet</hi> to thoſe wiſe and pious men that find it <hi>Neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Neceſſary it may be, and too oft is: It's hard keeping our own or the Churches Peace, unleſs both Parties will conſent: As much as in us lieth, and if it be poſſible, we muſt live peaceably with all men: But when it is not <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> we muſt lament the want of what we are not able to obtain. For all Chriſt's Miniſters to ſtand by and ſee well-meaning ignorant people, called as in God's name, to ſin againſt him, and flattered or frightned from Truth, Duty and Privileges, and to let ſuch work go on to the danger of Souls, and diſtracting of Chriſt's Churches without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, will hardly conſiſt with our Miniſterial Fidelity.</p>
            <p>Therefore as unneceſſary Wars, are the greatest complicate ſins in the World, and yet neceſſary Wars are the means of Peace; ſo it is in theſe Theological Wars: And as the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Defenders of their Country in neceſſary Wars, have right to the praiſes given them by all; ſo thoſe that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily defend God's Truth and his Churches Rights, deſerve acceptance. Among whom I judge the Reverend Author of this Treatiſe to be worthy of the Churches thanks, on ſeveral accounts. It is no contemptible Privilege which he vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. The Intereſt of all Chriſtians Children in the World, in the Covenant and Viſible Church of Chriſt, is a matter of greater moment, than moſt that acknowledge it do duly lay to heart, much more than the unthankful Rejecters of it underſtand. <hi>The Title given</hi> to the <hi>Pelagians</hi> was <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grati,</hi> the <hi>Unthankful,</hi> becauſe they diſputed againſt God's Grace, which they themſelves did need as well as others: Such <hi>Cicero</hi> thought thoſe Philoſophers that diſputed againſt the Immortality of Mans Soul: And Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> was long ago angry with me, for giving that Title to them that ſo vehemently diſpute all Infants out of the viſible Church and Covenant. But let the Evidence of the Cauſe well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:57924:10"/>inform us, and it will be too ſure, that <hi>Publick Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> would far better beſeem ſuch Writers as Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> than ſtiff perſisting in this unthankful Error.</p>
            <p>I have written ſomewhat my ſelf, upon Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> vehement inſtigation, once more on this Subject, partly in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and partly to himſelf. But let not the notice of that hinder you from reading this Treatiſe: For I have dealt with Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> only on the account of his pretended Witneſſes for a thouſand years after Chriſt, and his quarrels with my ſelf; having neither leiſure, nor will, nor patience (all things conſidered) to meddle with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (or the rest of his Hiſtory) while I know how ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently they ſtand confuted in my own and many other mens Writings long ago.) But this Reverend Author hath dealt with him more particularly, and anſwered his Arguments ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily, and ſearch'd into thoſe and all the reſt of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Antiquities, and not only done that which I have paſſed by, but the ſame alſo, in a full Confutation.</p>
            <p>And it is ſo ſad a Caſe, that after all our dreadful Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we ſhould ſtill be haunted with this unquiet Spirit which hath been exorciſed or laid ſo oft; and that under all our other Trials, we ſhould have the addition of theſe vexatious dividing Wranglings, to turn mens hearts against each other, that we owe the more thanks to ſuch as the Author, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much water to quench theſe flames: eſpecially in a time when ſo many diſaffected Perſons are ready, to impute to Presbyterians, Independents or any ſuch other, that they deſire to defame, the Errors of all about them, whom they do not confute; yea too oft alſo thoſe that they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute; while ſome others betray the Cauſe by ſilence, or ſilly unſatisfactory Arguings. Pardon (or chuſe) a man that offendeth all Sects by plain dealing, for telling the World, That if the Anabaptiſts had been no better confuted, than the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Silencers</hi> have confuted them, I verily think that ſo great a part of the conſcientious (though inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious) Vulgar would have followed them, as would have made work and trouble for us all.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The <hi>Authors</hi> firſt Argument, That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Baptiſme is the only true Baptiſm, drawn from Chriſts poſitive Inſtitution and Commiſſion. <hi>Mat. 28.18, 19. Mark 16.16.</hi> Examined and Confuted.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe are the prime <hi>Texts,</hi> upon which <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> lay the greateſt ſtreſs, as conceiving they have ſure warrant from hence, for <hi>their</hi> practice, and that from the ſame places <hi>Ours</hi> is condemnable. Out of this <hi>Armory</hi> do they fetch their keeneſt Weapons and moſt triumphant Arguments; And indeed all that they ſay beſides is, <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> a great ſound of words to little purpoſe. This is the <hi>Palmarium argumentum,</hi> their victorious and unanſwerable Argument, as they imagine ſo; None are to be Babtized, but thoſe who are firſt taught, but Infants are not teachable, <hi>Ergo</hi> they ought not to be baptized; and again, he that Believeth and is Baptized, Infants cannot believe, therefore muſt not be Baptized. We (ſay they) follow the Rule of Inſtitution,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57924:11"/>you who are <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> croſs it, and cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit our ſelves of <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> And I confeſs this is a plauſible way of arguing and very taking with <hi>Vulgar</hi> capacities, and I wonder, no more of weak underſtanding and tender conſciences are proſelyted to their way. They have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us, to gain upon <hi>ſuch.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great confidence, that they have both Scripture and Reaſon on their ſide, I hope, to make it appear to thoſe who are not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> that their Arguments weigh light in the Ballance of the Sanctuary. For as Mr. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> obſerves the words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in both theſe places of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sydenhams</hi> Chriſtian ſober and plain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation on Infant Baptiſm.</note> do not hold forth the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or the form or manner of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, being delivered in general, and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite terms — As <hi>all Nations, every creature</hi> by tranſitive words, <hi>Teach them, Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> Wherefore if theſe be the prime Inſtitution of Baptiſing, from which they exclude Infants, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſeth ſuch univerſal and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive expreſſions, we ſhall deſire (ſaith he) but to deal with them, on their ground, and the ſame Text will ſerve to prove our poſitions more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively then theirs. But that we may the better underſtand the import of both places, I ſhall a little explicate them by way of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, premiſing only this, that neither of them do contain the firſt inſtitution of Baptiſm, but only an inlargement of the Commiſſion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Firſt for that in <hi>Matthew — Go ye therefore and teach all Nations. Beza</hi> obſerves that in the antient Copies [therefore] is wanting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it he finds the particle [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] <hi>now,</hi> in one of moſt Antient date, which Circumſtance of time is of great remark. For now the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of baptizing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, now <hi>Chriſt</hi> was riſen, Circumciſion, which was the old ſeal of the Covenant of grace, under the former Adminiſtration, was broken and aboliſhed, and the Lord ordains a new one, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme, to take place inſtead thereof, under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>-Adminiſtration <hi>[go now]</hi> Now I am riſen, before which time neither Goſpel nor Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was to be offered them; For the command was, <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which properly ſignifies Teach ye; and ſo the Participle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is rightly rendred in the following words added to the charge [Teaching them to obſerve] Let us now come to ſee what improvement our oppoſits do make from hence to exclude the Infants of believers out of Chriſts Commiſſion to be Baptized, and that the Baptiſme of Believers is the only true Baptiſme. Their Argument in form runs thus, <hi>viz,</hi> Miniſters ought to follow their Commiſſion: But to make Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptizing, is the Miniſters Commiſſion. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we anſwer, That the Aſſumption is Ambiguous; for making Diſciples may be taken two ways.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57924:12"/>
               <p>Firſt, For an immediate preſent making only; and ſo it is not Chriſts Commiſſion, If you take it excluſively, as if none muſt be baptized but thoſe who immediately in their own perſons are made Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For a Mediate remote making alſo; and thus muſt the Commiſſion be underſtood. The meaning is, Baptize thoſe whom you find to be in a <hi>State</hi> of Diſciples, whether preſently by you, or formerly by ſome body elſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſonally by themſelves, or Seminally by and in their Parents. Let them be in <hi>State</hi> of Diſciples, and then, if not baptiz'd before, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <hi>them.</hi> It is the <hi>State</hi> of a Diſciple, not the time when, nor manner how, which the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizer is to look on. <hi>Ananias</hi> finding <hi>Saul</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> of a Diſciple muſt baptize him, though neither he, nor any Miniſter elſe before did make him ſo; however he being a Diſciple, though not made by man, muſt be baptized. Thus then take the Aſſumption, as it ought to be taken, and we grant the Argument; for it concludes not againſt Infant-Baptiſm, for they are Diſciples not of mans, but Gods making, vouchſafing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly in their believing Parents to accept them alſo into his Covenant, and ſo into the <hi>State</hi> of Diſciples, and conſequently by <hi>Chriſts</hi> own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>That infants of Believers are Diſciples is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were ſo under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Adminiſtration, and why not then under the new? The Proſelytes in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church coming in, brought their Infants into the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57924:12"/>capacity or ſtate of Proſelytes; therefore believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers coming in to be Diſciples, bring in their children to the ſame ſtate too, or elſe the ſtate of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is worſe in regard of outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges then the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By conferring that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. with that of <hi>Mark</hi> 9.41. it appears, that to belong to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is in <hi>Chriſts</hi> dialect the ſame with being a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> but Infants of Believers do belong to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To put all beyond doubt, we have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs word for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. Where the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> preſſing that it was needful to Circumciſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (that is, to be Proſelyted by Circumciſion) is called a putting a <hi>Yoke</hi> upon the Neck of the <hi>Diſciples.</hi> And ſince the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Proſelytes, both Fathers and Children, and the preſſing the continuance thereof among all <hi>Gentiles</hi> Proſelyted to Chriſtianity, is termed the putting a <hi>Yoke</hi> upon the Neck of the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the children as well as the Fathers muſt be meant by the Diſciples. There is no evaſion of this, though I find Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> keeps a great ſtir about it; for as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> argues, if they ſay it was meant of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Circumciſion, yet they muſt grant the <hi>Yoke</hi> was on their Children as to the Act, and if the <hi>Doctrine</hi> was ſo burthenſome, much more the <hi>Practice,</hi> which the poor Infants are under; And they are called Diſciples indefinitely, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themſelves or with their Parents; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinction be made, it muſt be in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of laying on the <hi>Yoke, viz.</hi> on the Parents
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57924:13"/>
                  <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> on the Children <hi>actually,</hi> but there can be no Reſtriction of the word <hi>Diſciple</hi> from theſe, on whom that <hi>Yoak</hi> was laid, as is expreſt in that Chapter.</p>
               <p>But it may farther be objected, The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it ſelf ſhews what kind of Diſciples <hi>Chriſt</hi> means in theſe words <hi>[Teaching them to obſerve]</hi> ſo as Infants are not concern'd as Diſciples in it, being in no capacity to be taught or to obſerve. But let it be withall conſidered, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> adds thoſe words to his charge in regard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the perſons, to whom he was ſending his <hi>Apoſtles, viz.</hi> to <hi>Nations, All Nations,</hi> that is, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were <hi>Aliens; All Nations</hi> here, being put in immediate Oppoſition to that one <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> They were ſent to them that were not in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and therefore they were to be made ſo, by preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual teaching. As the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Proſelytes</hi> that came into them were firſt taught and then Circumciſed, but their children were circumciſed before they were taught. So then in this commiſſion we muſt diſtinguiſh the ſubſtance from variable circumſtances. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is to <hi>baptize</hi> Diſciples, but whether by Precedent, Teaching, or not, depends on varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Perſons,</hi> to whom Chriſts Miniſters are ſent, be they <hi>ſuch</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were then ſent to, they muſt be <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuli facti,</hi> made Diſciples by Preaching, and then be Baptized: But be they the ſeed of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> they are <hi>Diſcipuli nati,</hi> born Diſciples by the Relation of the covenant, and ſo may have the ſeal ſet on them, without any preceding teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57924:13"/>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, not to inſiſt upon that, that Infants are Chriſts Diſciples, becauſe all Nations muſt be Diſcipled, and Infants are included in thoſe Nations; we conceive we have no obſcure ground for the Baptizing the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe as Mr. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſaith in his Examen, <hi>pag.</hi> 89. That it is well known, Baptiſme was in uſe among the Jews in the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Proſelytes for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; &amp; quotes <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> for it.</note> and Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> in his <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 10. do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, Baptiſm was in uſe as a kind of <hi>Initiation</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> though it was not a Sacrament till Chriſt his Inſtitution, and therefore this Rite ſeemed no ſtrange thing unto them, as appeareth by their coming to <hi>John,</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning not ſo much his <hi>Baptiſme</hi> as his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> by what <hi>authority</hi> he Baptized, <hi>John</hi> 1. 25. For (as the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves) the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who came firſt <hi>Meſſias</hi> to that people, was born of that Nation, lived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly under their law, and obſerved their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes) were by him drawn from their former practices in the old Teſtament, and ſo were lightly changed and accomodated to his own purpoſes; he inſtanceth in divers things, and at length comes to this of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> or <hi>Waſhing;</hi> a known right for initiating the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi> into the Covenant of the <hi>Lord.</hi> For he doth abundantly ſhew out of the <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Rabbies,</hi> that the way of entring into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was by <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> ſo ſays Mr. <hi>Godwyn</hi> alſo in the place before mentioned. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57924:14"/>as the <hi>Natural Jews</hi> were thus entred, ſo were the <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and as the <hi>Proſelytes</hi> of age, ſo alſo were their Infant-Children Baptized. So the <hi>Gemara Babyl. tit, Chetub. c.</hi> 1. They baptize the little, or young ſtranger, or Proſelyte, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it: And <hi>Maimonides</hi> in <hi>tit. Iſuri bia. c.</hi> 13. <hi>They Baptize the Infant or little Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, upon the knowledge of the houſe of judgement. i.e.</hi> on their deſire in behalf of their Children. From all which it appears that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Baptizing, was accomodated by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Right</hi> of our initiation of the Profeſſion of Chriſt; whereof (ſaith he) we have as little reaſon to doubt, as that a <hi>Picture</hi> was taken from that <hi>Face,</hi> which it reſembleth to the life. And from hence we have (as he conceives, and that very rationally) a clear foundation for our practice, namely, to baptize, not only thoſe who make a profeſſion of their Faith in Chriſt, but likewiſe their Children with them. And though ſome men of late years have denyed the warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs thereof, and darkned the truth by their arguings againſt it; yet one may well ſuppoſe it was clear and obvious enough to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (from the knowledge they had of the former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, which took-in the Children with the Parents into Covenant) for if it had not been Chriſts mind, believers Children ſhould be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Baptiſm under the <hi>new</hi> adminiſtration, he would certainly have given ſome intimation thereof, and given his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſome ſuch cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this (when he ſent them to Diſciple all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Baptize them) See that you do not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Children. Laſtly, we may from hence alſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57924:14"/>gain light, that the Eſſence of Baptiſm doth not lye in being <hi>immerſt</hi> or <hi>plunged</hi> under water, for it can never be proved that this was the manner of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Baptizing perſons or things. I ſhall ſhut up this with a paſſage of the Learned and Godly <hi>Bucer,</hi> upon theſe words,<note place="margin">Sane dum non habent locum quo praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur tantum doctos baptizari nihil, robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſuae ſententia hinc adferent; etenim nos docemus antequam baptizemus. Ne quid vel his, vel ioſpiam alibi Scripturarum habetur neminem bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizari debere, niſi ille Doctrinam Chriſti per ſe quoque perceperit. <hi>Bucer</hi> in locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Go teach all Nations Baptizing them.</hi> Since the Anabaptiſts (ſaith he) have no place of Scripture that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to Baptize none but thoſe that are taught, they cannot ſtrengthen their opinion from this Text: For we our ſelves do teach <hi>[i.e. Adult-Aliens]</hi> before we do baptize, neither can we from hence or any other Scripture prove, that no one ought to be Baptized, unleſs he ſhall underſtand or learn the Doctrine or <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> varies the words of the Commiſſion thus; <hi>Go ye into all the World and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature:</hi> The one hath it <hi>Nations,</hi> the other <hi>World,</hi> and the terms are equipollent, ſignifying the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. But what muſt they do in all the World? preach the Goſpel, <hi>i.e.</hi> publiſh abroad to all without exception, the <hi>freeneſs</hi> and fulneſs of Gods rich Grace in the New Covenant, even that ſame <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> that was preached long before to <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3.8. And this bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the <hi>Gentiles, ver.</hi> 14. And this is to be Preacht, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to every Creature, <hi>i.e.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57924:15"/>with a diſtinction to every humane creature, which the oppoſers of Infant-Baptiſme may do well to conſider, ſince they ſtand ſo rigidly upon the Syllabical Letters of every word in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſo as they will not allow us liberty to draw out the ſence of ſome places that relate to Infant-Baptiſm, from the Letter, by rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and conſequence, and according to the Harmony of Scripture, but we muſt ſuperſtitiouſly adhere to the very Syllables of the Text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as whatſoever appears truth, from the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, or by juſt conſequence is as <hi>practicable</hi> and <hi>obliging,</hi> as if it were written with a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam,</hi> in ſo many Capital Letters. It would be a ſenſeleſs undertaking indeed to Preach the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> to every individual creature in the World; and therefore it is to the underſtood reſtrictively of mankind, poor loſt man for whom Chriſt dyed. Laſtly, the Connection too, he, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> hath ſome difficulty in it, and the ſence is not ſo obvious to every capacity: for if it had, many of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between us and the Papiſts had never been, as, Whether Baptiſm be of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſalvation; which Proteſtants deny, and many Papiſts affirm. And let the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> well conſider that this <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> doth as cloſely conjoyn believing and being Baptized, to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the other doth, teaching and being baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if we muſt ſo exactly ſtand upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of words to prove the Inſtitution. We may (ſaith <hi>Sydenham</hi>) argue from <hi>Mark,</hi> as well as they from <hi>Matthew,</hi> as none muſt be baptized but they who are taught, ſo none but thoſe who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57924:15"/>believe and are Baptized ſhall be ſaved; and conſequently our Children cannot be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot believe. The ſame condition being required to precede Baptiſm, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to precede Salvation. You ſee whether the Argument may be carried, and what little ground of comfort ſuch doctrine affords in the death of our children. To conclude then, whereas they argue from this place of <hi>Mark,</hi> we muſt believe and be baptized, but Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, therefore may not be Baptized; will it not as directly follow, that ſince they can't believe, they muſt be damned; let them frame an anſwer to the one, and then they have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered both; for look (ſaith Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>) by what diſtinction they will maintain the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Infants againſt this Argument, by the ſame will I more clearly juſtifie the Baptiſm of Infants againſt this Argument.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared the Texts from the falſe gloſſes, Antipaedobaptiſts put upon them, we ſhall next examine the paſſages out of <hi>Authors,</hi> which my Antagoniſt quotes for his opinion.</p>
               <p>The firſt he brings is Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who having ſo notably wounded their cauſe in his plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof, for Infant Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſme, is become the man of their indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and Indeed I fear the <hi>Author,</hi> with whom I have to do, is poſſeſt with a malevolent ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Learned and Godly Divine, and is glad of any occaſion to wound his reputation, as appears by his dealing with him in his Preface, and divers other places in the Treatiſe. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (ſaith he) doth fully acknowledge in his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57924:16"/>Book called, the ſecond Diſputation of Right to Sacraments, <hi>pag.</hi> 149, 150. Where he ſaith, <hi>This</hi> (ſpeaking of the Commiſſion of Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>is not like ſome occaſional mentioning of Baptiſme; but it is the very Commiſſion it ſelf of Chriſt to his Diſciples, and purpoſely expreſſeth their ſeveral works in their ſeveral places and orders. Their firſt Task is to make Diſciples, which are by</hi> Mark <hi>called Believers. The ſecond work is to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, whereto is annext the promiſe of their Salvation. The third work is to teach them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which are after to be Learned in the School of Chriſt; to contemn this order (ſaith he) is to contemn all Rules of Order, for where can we expect to find it, if not here. I profeſs my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is fully ſatisfyed, that the Miniſter muſt expect a profeſſion of Faith before Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To diſcover the Craft, and Siniſter dealing of our Opponent, I muſt firſt acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> diſputing with Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> who was for a large Admiſſion to the Sacraments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the <hi>Theſis</hi> in his ſecond diſputation thus, <hi>viz. That Miniſters muſt not Baptize the Children of thoſe that profeſs not ſaving faith, upon profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any Faith that is ſhort of it;</hi> theſe are his very words, <hi>pag.</hi> 53. And after it, nine lines lower, that he might not be miſtaken, hath this by way of caution, <hi>viz. That he would have the Reader to underſtand that all along in the diſcourſe of the whole Book, the diſpute is about the aged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether they may be baptized; ſo that it is none of our work at this time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to defend the Subjects [as to their age] againſt the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, but our preſent buſineſs is to enquire what that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57924:16"/>faith is, that quallifieth perſons to be juſt ſubjects of Baptiſm, or to be ſuch whoſe children may receive it upon the account of their faith or profeſſion;</hi> Diſp. 2. p. 4. Moreover in his fourth Diſputation he hath this paſſage; <hi>We take it for granted that the Right of Infants is upon the account of their Parents Faith, therefore we manage this diſcourſe with reſpect to the Adult.</hi> P. 351. What could any man in the World ſay more, to prevent the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of unworthy perſons? And certainly he had not ſaid ſo much unleſs he had known how our oppoſites lye at the <hi>Catch,</hi> and yet we ſee this would not do, for we have found a man of ſo much diſ-ingenuity as to traduce and pervert the ſayings of this worthy perſon to countenance his <hi>errour.</hi> I have been the larger in ſetting down Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words, that it may leave ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the <hi>Readers</hi> Memory, when he finds any thing quoted out of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, about the Right to Sacraments, that ſo it might be as a Key to open his meaning, in all thoſe numerous paſſages the <hi>Author</hi> hath pikt up out of that Diſpute, which indeed fills up many pages of his Book.</p>
               <p>Next we have Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> introduced as ſpeaking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in favour of their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,<note place="margin">
                     <p>Ergò ut ſe ritè ad Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum offerant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, peccatorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio ab illis requiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; alioqui, nihil quam inane eſſet lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrum tota actio.

                  </note> whereas few ever wrote ſo ſmartly againſt them; it is from that ſame paſſage of his, on <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that men may rightly offer themſelves to Baptiſme, Confeſſion of ſin is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57924:17"/>otherwiſe the whole action would be but Sport.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words indeed are Mr. <hi>Calvins,</hi> ſo that I confeſs my Antagoniſt ſpeaks truth, but he ſhould have done well to have ſpoken the whole truth, For Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adds, — <hi>It is to be Noted, that theſe words are ſpoken of Adult perſons.</hi> And that we may ſee his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fully take notice of his Paraphraſe upon the 28. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. and that other Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to teach before he commands us to Baptize, and he would have believers only admitted to Baptiſm; it ſeems Baptiſm is not rightly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, unleſs faith goeth before. From this place</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>the Anabaptiſts oppoſe Infant Baptiſm.</hi> To which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwers, <hi>That thoſe whom we ſee by a Profeſſion of their Faith, to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, we are to look upon them (together with their off-ſpring) as the members of Chriſt, and to be jointly called to the inheritance of the Saints, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Baptiſm hereby ſeparated from Faith, and Teaching; becauſe though children have not yet faith by reaſon of their Age.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57924:17"/>their Parents into Covenant, they themſelves are alſo to be imbraced in the ſame Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Calvin,</hi> comes <hi>Piſcator,</hi> to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whoſe words on <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. are theſe; <hi>It is called the Baptiſme of Repentance, becauſe</hi> John <hi>Preached remiſſion of ſins to the penitent Believers.</hi> But why ſhould this worthy <hi>Author</hi> be thus cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd, whenas he farther expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Baptiſmus nulli adulto conferendus eſt, niſi prius ediderit confeſſionem peocatorum,</hi> i.e. <hi>We muſt not Baptize any perſon that is grown up, unleſs he firſt make a Profeſſion of his Faith,</hi> &amp;c. If we would know his mind more fully, we may ſee it in his Comment upon the 28. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>It was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Duty of the Apoſtles</hi> to Preach the Goſpel all abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57924:18"/>then adds — Not only Adult perſons, that do believe and profeſs their Faith, belong to the Church, but alſo their <hi>Children</hi> as appears from the words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy, where (ſaith he) the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls their children holy that were born, though but one of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were a Believer, foraſmuch as they belong to Gods Covenant made with his Church, and by conſequence they belong to the Church; wherefore we need not doubt, but they alſo, (I ſay the Children or Infants of Believers) are to be Baptized, although they are not capable of Faith, even as the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, belonging likewiſe to the Covenant and to the Church.</p>
               <p>And as if all our eminent Divines had heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ſpoken ſomething in favour of their way, he hath the confidence to bring in more ſtill.

Here we are to conſider the Order which God obſerves in making with men a Covenant in Baptiſm. Firſt of all he calls them by his word, and commands them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to repent. Then in the ſecond place, God makes his promiſe of mercy and forgiveneſs. And thirdly be ſeals his promiſe by Baptiſm. They that know not, nor conſider this Order which God uſed in Covenanting with them in Baptiſm, deal prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, over-ſlipping the Commandment of Repenting and Believing.</hi>

               <p>Who would not think by this, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Perkins</hi> were of his ſide, a down right Antipaedobaptiſt; whereas not a word of what he ſaith is intended againſt Infant-Baptiſme, but only to ſhew in what order Baptiſme is to be Adminiſtred to <hi>Aliens</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> as appears by what he ſaith upon the ſame Text. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29.

               <p>ALthough what we have before ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate his main Argument drawn from the <hi>Inſtitution of Chriſt,</hi> be ſufficient to overthrow whatſoever is brought in the two following Chapters; yet we ſhall further add, that it is not to be denyed, that the Apoſtles aſſert Believers Baptiſme to be a true Baptiſm, but that they teach us that it is the only true Baptiſme is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe, and we have only the Authors word for it. The Texts cited out of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.29. prove, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57924:19"/>grown perſons unbaptized ought to be required to believe before their Baptiſm, which we grant; but to inferr thence, that the Children of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Believers are not to be Baptized, is more then theſe Texts (or any elſe that I know) can yeild. We read of none <hi>de facto</hi> that the Apoſtles Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,<note place="margin">A non dicto ad non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, non valet conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia: Becauſe it is not expreſt in ſo many words therefore it was not done, is not Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</note> but Believers; therefore none but ſuch, <hi>de jure</hi> ought to be Baptized, is a ſorry way of arguing. The words of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Baptiſme, part 2. pag. 34. are very weighty, <hi>viz. A Negative argument for matters of fact in Scripture, cannot conclude,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And therefore ſuppoſing that it be not intimated that the Apoſtles did Baptize Infants, it follows not (ſaith the Dr.) that they did not: and if they did not, it does not follow that they might not, or that the Church may not. The Scripture ſpeaks nothing of the Baptiſme of the</hi> Virgin Mary, <hi>and of many of the Apoſtles; therefore they were not baptized, is a weak arguing. The words and deeds of Chriſt are infinite which are not recorded,</hi> Joh. 20.30. and 21.25. <hi>Many things Chriſt did, that were not written; and of the Acts of the Apoſtles we may ſuppoſe the ſame in their proportion; and therefore what they did not, is no rule to us, unleſs they did it not, becauſe they were forbideen: So that it can be no good Argument to ſay, The</hi> Apoſtles <hi>are not read to have Baptized Infants, therefore Infants are not to be baptized; but thus, We do not find they are excluded from this Sacrament and Ceremony of

                  <hi>Now ſince all contradiction againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, depends wholly upon theſe two grounds; The Negative Argument in matter of fact, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that faith and repentance are required to Baptiſme; ſince the firſt is wholly nothing and infirm, upon an infinite account; and the ſecond may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Infants can no more be ſaved then be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, becauſe faith is more neceſſary to Salvation then to Baptiſme; it being ſaid, he that believeth not ſhall be damned; and it is not ſaid, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be excluded from Baptiſm; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Doctrine of thoſe that refuſe to Baptize their Infants is upon both its legs weak and broken, and inſufficient.</hi> Thus far the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Doctor.</hi> To conclude this, whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Preached up faith and Repentance before Baptiſm, it was requiſite they ſhould do ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Commiſſion, having to do with <hi>Aliens</hi> grown up, (as not only the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> were; in reference to the new Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;) for theſe being the firſt ſubjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it was neceſſary they ſhould make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith before they were admitted to it, but not ſo in their Children to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, no more then in <hi>Iſaac</hi> and the Children of the Proſelytes to be Circumciſed. <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved firſt, and afterward was Circumciſed; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.24. And why ſo? Becauſe he was the firſt ſubject of that Ordinance, and therefore could not be admitted to it, but by his own faith. But as for <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son, he was Circumciſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing, and ſo was it with the Proſelytes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57924:20"/>and their Children; when any <hi>Gentile</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith, he had a perſonal Right to be circumciſed, and his Child likewiſe was Circumciſed at eight days old, as was the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, by virtue of Gods Covenant, giving it a parental Right.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> is very unhappy at Citations, for uſually they ſerve not his purpoſe. He acquaints us out of <hi>Bede,</hi> that men were <hi>inſtructed</hi> into the knowledge of the Truth, then to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as Chriſt hath taught, becauſe without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. <hi>Magdeburg. Cent.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 220. But this, <hi>Bede</hi> himſelf tells us was the method uſed amongſt the Inhabitants of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> when Paganiſh — <hi>In initio naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centis Eccleſiae apud Britannos, Beda lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Angl. Hiſt. cap.</hi> 14. When a Church firſt of all began to be planted amongſt the Britains; and he tells us it was at that time when <hi>Gregory</hi> ſent from <hi>Rome, Auſtin,</hi> and forty other Preachers, and afterward <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who converted <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King; but of this we ſhall ſpeak more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we ſhall ſhew how <hi>Bede</hi> himſelf was for Infant-Baptiſme, notwithſtanding the <hi>Author</hi> ſo perverts his words.</p>
               <p>His other Citation is <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who in his Paraphraſe upon <hi>Mat.</hi> Obſerveth (and tis a great Obſervation indeed,) <hi>That the Apoſtles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded firſt to teach, and then to baptize,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </note> but if you would know his judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infant-Baptiſm, you may read it in his <hi>Ratio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionandi,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57924:21"/>lib.</hi> 4. where he conceives it probable, that the Apoſtles ordain'd and practiſed it.</p>
               <p>And truly amongſt other probable reaſons this ſeems to be one, if it be not a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely, becauſe we do not read of any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing Parents who were Baptized when they came to years of diſcretion. That they were Baptized I preſume (ſaith <hi>Brinſley</hi>) our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries will not deny; and if ſo,<note place="margin">Note, No Children of Believing Parents Baptized afterwards to be found from <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt ending his Miniſtry, which was about 60. years. An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient, if not to convince the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary that they were Baptized in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, yet to ſtop their mouths: <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley</hi> Doctrine and Practice of Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme, pag. 75.</note> let them ſhew <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>when.</hi> For this let all the <hi>Sacred Regiſter</hi> be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the time that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> began his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to the time that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ended his, (which was about 60 years, during which time thouſands of Children of Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were grown up to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity;) and if in all that time they can but ſhew any one inſtance of any child born of a believing Parent, whoſe Baptiſm was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till he came to years of diſcretion, and that then he was Baptized, we will then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is ſome ſtrength in their <hi>Negative Allegation, viz.</hi> We read of no children Baptized, <hi>therefore</hi> There were none.</p>

               <p>TO this there needs no more then what we have before ſaid.<note place="margin">Sydenhams <hi>Chriſtian Exercitation,</hi> pag. 7.</note> For as Mr. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> ſays, all that they urge as to Examples of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Believers, being baptized all along the new Teſtament, eſpecially the <hi>Acts,</hi> (and that if thou believeſt thou mayſt,) We can freely grant without any damage to Infant-Baptiſm: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We ſay as they, Profeſſing Believers, grown men were firſt Baptized, and ſo they ought to be who are to be the firſt ſubjects of the Adminiſtration of an Ordinance;</hi> inſtancing as before in <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. he was 99. years old when circumciſed, and he muſt be firſt Circumciſed before he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a right to his ſeed; now you may as well argue, <hi>Abraham</hi> was firſt circumciſed, when ſo old, therefore old perſons are to be Circumciſed and none elſe; as becauſe grown perſons were Baptized, therefore not Infants, when they muſt be firſt Baptized themſelves; for children are Baptized by the promiſe firſt to them, and in them to their ſeed.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57924:22"/>

               <p n="2">2.

I acknowledge that to <hi>Adult</hi> perſons Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme reprefents (in a ſign) that to the eye which is Preacht to the eare, reſpecting the Myſteries of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Although I ſee not how it can be ſo in the way of <hi>Dipping,</hi> for how can perſons under water ſee, apprehend, or hear any thing during that time, when, and whereby the Sences and Underſtandings of men are ſo confounded, that they have no power to exerciſe their faith, or reaſon as they ſhould; and ſince plunging over head and ears puts people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an amazing condition, not without frights (eſpecially in the more tender Sex) ſome being neer throtled or drown'd, it is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be none of Chriſts appointments; for one would think, that at ſuch a juncture of time, eſpecially, when an Ordinance is celebrated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting ſo many Goſpel Myſteries, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the mind ſhould be in a more ompoſed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57924:24"/>then theirs are like to be in, whoſe heads are under Water. We grant Baptiſm to be a ſign of ſpiritual Myſteries repreſented to the eye of ſuch as are grown up, and rightly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. As Circumciſion was a ſign of the ſame import to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it is of preſent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate uſe to the aged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eived the ſign of Circumciſion, as the <hi>Seal</hi> of the righteouſneſs of Faith, and we acknowledge alſo both the Sacraments are of immediate and preſent uſe to the aged, and in this ſence we are to underſtand <hi>Paraeus,</hi> ſpeaking of Sacramental Signes: but let it be conſidered that the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> received the ſign of Circumciſion as well as <hi>Abrabam,</hi> and yet they were void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and judgment, and knew no more of the ſpiritual Myſteries repreſented therein, then our Infants do in the Ordinance of Baptiſm. Circumciſion repreſented the ſame Myſteries that Baptiſm doth, and yet thoſe poor <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Babes that were Circumciſed, knew not that the cutting-off the fore-skin, ſhadowed out the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, and the nature of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the blood ſhed in the act alſo held out the myſtery of Redemption by Chriſts blood, of all which Baptiſme is as proper a ſign, when given to our Infants, as Circumciſion was to theirs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What though Infants are uncapable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Goſpel Myſteries figured in Baptiſm, as they were heretofore of the ſame ſhadowed forth in Circumciſion, yet their Baptiſme is a <hi>Signe</hi> of what <hi>God</hi> will do for the future (to as many of them as belong to his Election,)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57924:25"/>if they ſhall arrive to years of diſcretion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though it be no <hi>Teaching</hi> ſign at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet if the Infant live, and be inſtructed in the uſe and ends of his Baptiſme, it may prove as Operative and Beneficial to him, as if it had been delayed till he came to full age.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>David,</hi> who though Circumciſed in Infancy, yet ſtrengthned his faith by it, when he came to years of diſcretion, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 17.26.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though Baptiſme be not for the preſent a <hi>Teaching</hi> ſign to Infants, neverthelſes it is a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing</hi> fign to diſtinguiſh thoſe that are <hi>Within,</hi> from thoſe that are <hi>Without,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle phraſeth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. And it is even to Infants a ſign of Gods Covenant as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is hinted (as Circumciſion was to Infants under the Law, and for this reaſon it is by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimy</hi> called by the name of the Covenant, and did diſtinguiſh the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants from <hi>Gentile</hi> ones, that were without the Covenant, or ſtrangers to the ſame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is alſo an <hi>Engaging</hi> ſign (as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants, though they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertood it not when they were the Subjects of that Ordinance) whereby our children are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> into whoſe name they have been Baptized. I ſhall ſhut up this with thoſe weighty words which I find in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Scripture proof for Infants Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſm. <hi>pag.</hi> 112. Tell me (ſaith he) what operation Circumciſion had on all the Infants of Church-Members formerly. It
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57924:25"/>was a ſign of the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet they had no more Faith, nor Knowledge of the Significancy, than ours have now—<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was circumciſed in Infancy, when by the courſe of nature he was uncapable of underſtanding it's Ends and Uſes. Not (ſaith he) that I am now arguing for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from Circumciſion; but this fully anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their Objection [that Infants ſhould not be baptized, becauſe they are not capable of underſtanding its Uſe, and ſo being wrought on by it.] They are as capable of Baptiſm, as they were of Circumciſion, and its Ends: They therefore that will yet ſay, It were better let it alone till they are more capable, do but exalt their own reaſon againſt Scripture, and ſpeak as men that would teach <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second End, hinted by the Author, is, <hi>That the party baptized might thereby witneſs his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentanee,</hi> Matth. 3.11. <hi>called therefore the baptiſm of Repentance,</hi> Mark. 1.</p>

               <p>It cannot be proved from theſe places, that all thoſe whom <hi>John</hi> Baptized, did manifeſt their Repentance; and we do not find thoſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> that are branded with the name of Vipers, gave the leaſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, which if they had the Baptiſts would not have ſpoken ſo harſhly of them, and yet theſe (for ought we can learn to the contrary from the Text,) were baptized.</p>

               <p>If this Argument were good, it would have overthrown the Circumciſion of Infants; for that alſo was a lively Sign, or Symbole of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and it might have been objected (according to our Antagoniſts phanfie,) Infants are not regenerated, or ſhew no ſigns thereof; and (Regeneration being the end of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>therefore</hi> They ought not to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. According to ſuch arguing, none ought to be admitted to Baptiſm; for none know by a judgment of certainty and infallibility, who are regenerated; for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> made a great ſhew, and yet was in the Gall of bitterneſs

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>The Author brings in Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> (whom he looks upon as his dear friend, and he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, having helpt him to a great part of his Book;) The ſaid Dr. (ſaith he) tells us very elegantly in his <hi>Lib.</hi> of Prophecy, pag. 242. <hi>That this is truly to be Baptized, whatſoever is leſs then this, is but the Symbole only, a meer Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mony, an</hi> opus operatum, <hi>a dead Letter, an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhadow, an Inſtrument without an Agent to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, or force to actuate it.</hi>

               <p>The Dr. wants not words, but this ſignifies nothing againſt Infant-Baptiſm, for all this may be as truly ſaid of thoſe that are Baptized when grown up, that have not truth of grace. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I obſerve with what Reverence this Doctor is mentioned (as if all were Canonical which he ſaith in their behalf, and I find the <hi>Authors</hi> Book to ſwell with his <hi>Seſquipedalia verba,</hi>) I ſhall (for prevention of deluſion) inform the Reader with ſome news which may be worth his hearing. Know therefore that the ſaid Doctor put forth a Book about 20. years ſince, entituled, <hi>The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Prophecy,</hi> in which he pleads for a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as for others, ſo alſo for thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Infant-Baptiſme. There he perſonates an Anabaptiſt, and tells us he will draw up a <hi>Scheme</hi> or <hi>Plea</hi> for them, and (ſaith he) <hi>though they be deceived,</hi> yet they have ſo great excuſe of their ſide, that their <hi>Error</hi> is not impudent, <hi>lib.</hi> of <hi>Proph. p.</hi> 223. and therefore may be tolerated. Then doth he ſhew what they may ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves — and concludes, Thus far the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts may argue, and they have been incouraged in their <hi>Error,</hi> more by the accidental Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we have given them by our weak arguings, then by any <hi>Truth</hi> of their cauſe, or excellency of their wit. The Doctor therefore having a mind (it ſeems) to ſhew the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his own wit,<note place="margin">A worthy Teſtimony to be brought againſt Infant-Baptiſme.</note> hath ſaid more for them then ever they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57924:28"/>could before or ſince ſay for themſelves: ſo that his ſtrong arguings for them, hath eventually proved a greater encouragement to them then ever any of our weak arguings did before. And yet after all the goodly <hi>Harrangue</hi> he makes in their behalf, he at laſt ſhuts up with this, <hi>viz. The uſe I make of it</hi> (never dreaming what uſe <hi>H.D.</hi> would make of it) <hi>is,</hi> That ſince there is no direct impiety in their opinion, they are by all means Chriſtian, fair, and humane, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and inſtructed; but if they cannot be perſwaded, they muſt be left to <hi>God,</hi> (and I am of his mind.) And laſtly adds, for his own part he believes Infant-Baptiſm to be a truth; but becauſe ſome have thought the Doctor had ſpoke more in their behalf, then he himſelf could well anſwer (as <hi>Conjurers</hi> ſometimes raiſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits they cannot lay,) he hath ſince put forth an Excellent piece, ſtiled, A <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the practice of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Baptizing Infants</hi> of <hi>Believing Parents,</hi> and the Practiſe juſtified:<note place="margin">Printed by <hi>J.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57924:28"/>may ſeem good one againſt another, but thoſe in the Plea for the Anabaptiſts, have no ſtrength but what is accidental (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.)</p>

               </p>
               <p>The 5 End of Baptiſme, <hi>is to be a Sign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Gods part of waſhing away a Believers ſin, by the Blood of Chriſt, and to give ſpiritual Life and Salvation,</hi> Act. 2.38, 39. Act. 22.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Though children cannot put on <hi>Chriſt</hi> by an external <hi>Act,</hi> yet they may be an infuſed ſeed of grace, and we have good ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all elect Infants dying, have in their infant-State, done ſo.

Surely it muſt be ſo, or elſe there is no way how Infants can be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his laſt diſcourſe of Baptiſm, gives a good Rule for the underſtanding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this ſort, which if attended to, would bring us and Antipaedobaptiſts a little neerer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of the effects of, or diſpoſitions to Baptiſme, it ſpeaks in general expreſſions, as being moſt apt to ſignifie a common duty, or general effect, or a more Univerſal event, or the proper order of things: but thoſe general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57924:32"/>do not <hi>ſupponere univerſalitèr;</hi> that is, they are not to be underſtood excluſively to all ſuſcipients, or of all the ſubjects of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And he makes it clear by divers paſſages of Scripture. There are many <hi>Synecdoches</hi> in the word, where <hi>many</hi> only are to be underſtood, when it ſpeaks of <hi>all.</hi> The ſecret effects of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of the ſpirit are in Scripture attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to all that are of the outward Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.</note> So <hi>Peter</hi> calls all the Chriſtian ſtrangers of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern diſperſion, <hi>Elect, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fore-knowledge of God the Father.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians, and the ſame of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that their <hi>Faith was ſpoken</hi> of in all the world, and yet among them it is not to be ſuppoſed, that all the Profeſſors had an unreproveable faith, or that every one of the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> was an excellent and charitable perſon; and yet, ſaith he,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>your faith groweth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,</hi> and the charity of every one of you all towards each other aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. So to the queſtion before us. <hi>As many of you as are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> That is, ſo it is regularly, and this is the deſigned event: but from hence we cannot conclude of every perſon, and in every period of time, <hi>This man hath been baptized,</hi> therefore, <hi>now he is clothed with Chriſt, he hath put on Chriſt;</hi> nor thus, <hi>This perſon cannot in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as yet put on Chriſt, therefore he hath not been baptized;</hi> that is, <hi>he hath not put him on in a Sacramental</hi> ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57924:32"/>
               <p>To conclude, We cannot underſtand the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in thoſe words of putting on Chriſt, to intend a <hi>ſaving</hi> union to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or a putting on of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpiritually and effectually, in regard of all that are Baptized; for all theſe <hi>Galathians</hi> did not ſo put him on, and innumerable perſons that are Hypocrites (when baptized at age,) do not ſo put him on. Wherefore the words are to be underſtood <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. And thus <hi>Infants</hi> put on Chriſt as well as <hi>grown</hi> perſons.</p>
               <p n="7">7th. End of Baptiſm (ſaith he) <hi>is, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſon may orderly thereby have an entrance into the viſible Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For as Circumciſion heretofore was the viſible door of entrance into the old Teſtament-Church— So alſo was Baptiſme ſuch a door, and viſible entrance into the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Church,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 2.41, 42. <hi>They who gladly received the word were baptized, and the ſame day there was added to them about</hi> 3000. <hi>ſouls; and they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers. So that after baptiſme, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the believers were ſaid to partake of all the Church-priviledges.</hi>

                  <hi>Poſito uno abſurdo mille ſequuntur.</hi> Upon this falſe <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> do our Oppoſites build their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Practices. Wherefore we deny that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth give <hi>formality,</hi> or make a man a member of a Viſible-Church; it is not that which gives entrance into it, as the Author would have it: ſo, as if only by its Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in their own way too, perſons muſt be Baptized, or elſe they are not to be reputed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57924:33"/>Church-Members, or to be admitted into the participation of Church-priviledges. But for this we have divers of our Divines quoted; as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus,</hi> The Aſſembly in their Catechiſme. And laſtly, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> with whom he is again at <hi>Hocus Pocus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (ſaith he) in his plain Scripture proof, pag. 24. <hi>As a Soldier before li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and a King before Corwning, and taking his Oath, ſo are we Church-Members before Baptiſme. But as every one that muſt be admitted ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Army, muſt be admitted by liſting, as the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ingaging ſign; ſo every one that hath right to be ſolemnly admitted into the viſible Church, muſt ordinarily be admitted by Baptiſm.</hi> But mark <hi>(Reader)</hi> the <hi>Authors</hi> ingenuity. <hi>Baxters</hi> words are, <hi>So are we and Infants Church-Members;</hi> But being quite out of charity with thoſe Innocent Babes, this man leaves out Infants, and one would think by the partial Citation, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alſo did ſhut the Church-door againſt them. It cannot be denyed that Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have frequently termed Baptiſm, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our initiation into the Church, and have aſcribed our Admiſſion or entrance into it thereunto, and hereby have given the Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts ſome ſeeming ground for their rigidity. And yet I find that they are not agreed among themſelves about the point; for Mr. <hi>Paul</hi> a great Zealot againſt Communion with any that are not Baptized in their way, doth in his ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections diſown the Poſition, That Baptiſm is an initiating Ordinance, and tells us in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minitive Volume of his, p. 3. That he knows none that aſſerts it to be the in-let into praticular
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57924:33"/>Churches, though it prepares them for Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mr. <hi>Kiffin</hi> it ſeems is of the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he beſtows an Epiſtle upon the piece. Of the ſame judgment is <hi>John Bunyan</hi> a more moderate Antipaedobaptiſt, that is, for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion with Saints, as Saints,</hi> and condemnes the Rigidity of his Brethren, and maintains in his Anſwer to the ſcurrilous (not ſerious) Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Paul, That differences in judgement about Water-Baptiſme, ought to be no Bar to Communion,</hi>

And whereas <hi>Paul</hi> denies Baptiſme to be an initiating Ordinance, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts very rationally upon him, that if it be not that, but another, and if viſible Saints may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Fellowſhip by that other, and are no where forbidden ſo to do, becauſe they have not light into Water-Baptiſme, it is of weight to be conſidered by all unprejudiced perſons. Mr. <hi>Tull</hi> alſo, a moderate and very ingenious Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, is of Mr. <hi>Bunyans</hi> judgment; But Mr. <hi>Henry Jeſſey</hi> (of precious Memory) hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his judgment to the ſame purpoſe, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1.3.7. ſuch as are weak in the faith, receive you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence he argues moſt ſtrongly and convincingly, that it was the duty not only of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57924:34"/>the then preſent Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the Epiſtle was writ, as alſo to all beloved of God, called to be Saints at that time, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. But alſo of all Churches and Saints, <hi>Beloved</hi> and called, throughout the world in ſucceeding ages, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into Church-communion and Fellowſhip, ſuch whom we have ground to believe God hath received into Communion with himſelf. For that's the Argument or Motive <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>God hath received him,</hi> and ſaith he, if it be a good Argument to receive ſuch as are weak in any thing whom the Lord hath received; <hi>Then there can be no good Argument to reject for any thing for which the Lord will not reject them.</hi> The like argument we have chap. 15. ver. 7. of Chriſts Receiving, <hi>Receive you one another as Chriſt hath received us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then that holy man breaks out into pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſtrains, Oh! how is the heart of God the Father and the Son ſet upon this to have his children in one anothers hearts as they are in his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 'tis the work of the Devil (ſaith he) to divide them: Thus much to ſhew how they differ amongſt themſelves about this Poſition, that Baptiſm gives <hi>formality,</hi> or makes a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a viſible Church, which the moderate party amongſt them utterly deny; now that it gives neither eſſence or being, either to a Church or Memberſhip, further appears by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If there be a Church,</hi>
                  <note place="bottom">That dividing Principle, That Baptiſm formes a Church or makes Church-Members, refuted.</note> and ſo Members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57924:34"/>
                  <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> then Baptiſm cannot give the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality or eſſence, becauſe <hi>forma</hi> is cauſal, and ſo is in <hi>nature</hi> before <hi>formatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Church conſidered as <hi>totum eſſentiale,</hi> is before Baptiſm, <hi>for Miniſters are before baptiſm.</hi> And there muſt be a <hi>Church of Believers</hi> to <hi>choſe a Miniſter lawfully;</hi> for none but a <hi>Church</hi> can give him a call, and without a call he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not adminiſter, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> argues in his <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the ſum of Church-diſcipline, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 55. adding moreover, that if <hi>Baptiſm</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without a <hi>Miniſterial Church,</hi> nor that before a <hi>Church Congregational,</hi> which muſt make choice of a miniſtry, then ſuch a Church is much before Baptiſm. Beſides let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (ſaith he) that at the coming of ſome God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zealous Chriſtian and Scholar into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a company of Pagans (many) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith, I ask whether theſe may not joyn in Church-Fellowſhip, and chooſe that man <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and whether that choice was not lawful according to God? Therefore here is a Church before a Miniſter, and ſo before Baptiſm. The demand which Mr. <hi>Jeſſey</hi> makes upon the ſame arugments is ſomewhat like this; if Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (ſaith he) be the manner of forming Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, how would it ſuit a Country, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are converted and willing to be Baptized? but there being no Church to be baptized into, how ſhall ſuch a Church-State begin? The firſt muſt be baptized into no Church [that is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular] and the reſt into him as the Church, or the work ſtand ſtill for want of a Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Church may be without Baptiſm, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57924:35"/>yet as real a Church as the Iſraelites were ſo long in the Wilderneſs without Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which without diſpute was the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance, according to Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One Argument I ſhall borrow more from Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and that is, <hi>If Baptiſm give the form</hi> to viſible-memberſhip, <hi>then while that remains valid, the party is a viſible Member;</hi> for where the <hi>form</hi> is, the <hi>formatum</hi> muſt needs be, if the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon may take place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is true Baptiſm reſting in the party who hath no viſible Memberſhip:</hi> as in an <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> in him that renounceth the fellowſhip of the Church, or when the Church is utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, then all Church-Memberſhip ceaſeth; for <hi>Relata mutuò ſe ponunt &amp; tellunt;</hi> And yet Baptiſm is valid. And as it is an undeniable poſition, That, that which gives the form or being to a Church, muſt ceaſe when the Church ceaſeth, or when a member ceaſeth to be a member, it muſt ceaſe with it; ſo it follows that that muſt be renewed, namely Baptiſm, as often as Memberſhip is renewed, ſo ſhall we have a multiplication of Baptiſms, as often as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is caſt out of the Church and taken in again upon his repentance.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe two Scriptures which the <hi>Author</hi> brings for his opinion, they will hardly be found to ſerve his turn.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The main place ſtood upon is, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, <hi>As many as received the word gladly, were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57924:35"/>and there was added that day about</hi> 3000. <hi>ſouls.</hi> Hence they conclude they were added by Baptiſm, and that they were only added this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It is more then the Text affords for to conclude that they were added by Baptiſm, much leſs can it be argued from thence, that they were <hi>only</hi> added this way, the words ſay not, they were added by Baptiſm, but puts a full point or ſtop after that ſentence, <hi>As many as glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received the word, were baptized.</hi> There that ſentence ends, as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> notes upon the place: And the Apoſtle goes on a new account, and ſaith, <hi>There were added that day</hi> 3000. <hi>ſouls,</hi> but doth not at all ſhew the manner of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; ſo that theſe words are rather a recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation and ſumming up the number of Church-Members added that day, then any deſcription of the way of their taking into the Church, and the former reaſons prove it cannot be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as our Author would have it.</p>
               <p>The other place that he urgeth for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>We are all baptized into one body;</hi> hence 'tis concluded Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm imbodies Members.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In anſwer to this, let it be conſidered what thoſe of their one party ſay, that are for Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. The Text (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bunyan,</hi> that treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of our being baptized into one body) tells us expreſly it is done by the ſpirit. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body.</hi> Here is the Church preſented as under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Containing his fifth Argument; That Believers Baptiſm is the only Baptiſm, from the New Teſtament-diſpenſation, ſo differing from that of the old.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Argument is taken from the <hi>New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Diſpenſation, ſo different from the Old. The Old Teſtament-Church</hi> (ſaith the Author <hi>was National,</hi> conſiſting <hi>of the Natural and Fleſhly ſeed of Abraham, therefore were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by Circumciſion added thereto; but the new Teſtament-Church was by Chriſts appointment to be a ſeparated people out of all Nations, conſiſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham, and therefore Believers upon profeſſion of Faith by the Ordinance of Baptiſm were added thereto.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What of all this? If there any ground from hence that Believers Baptiſm is the only true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? 'Tis true, the Church Diſpenſation is altered,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> plain proof for Infants Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſm.</note> but the Covenant of Grace is not altered. The Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation differs under the new Teſtament, only in regard of Ceremonial acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as Temple, Prieſthood, Sacrifice; but the Eſſentials of the Covenant ſtill remain, <hi>viz.</hi> I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57924:37"/>this is the grand Charter of Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which takes in the Child with the Parent, and conſequently entitles it to Baptiſm, as ſhall be hereafter ſhewn; for if their Church relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made good, their Baptiſm will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it. If therefore the <hi>Author</hi> could have proved that the covenant had been altered as to its eſſentials, he had ſaid ſomething worth a hearing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he ſays the old Teſtament Church was <hi>National,</hi> it is a Truth; and yet the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews was not the Church of <hi>God,</hi> as they deſcended from the Loyns of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Natural</hi> Generation, according to the Fleſh, but only with reference to Gods gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, (which I wiſh the Oppoſers of Infant-Baptiſme would conſider:) and as this Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed after the fleſh, ſo likewiſe is it ſtill the ſame with Believers, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed under the <hi>Goſpel-Diſpenſation,</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſame gracious covenant made to <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>ſeed, Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>For the promiſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off:</hi> [the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="3">3. Antipaedobaptiſts may do well to conſider yet farther, what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes good in his plain proof, <hi>viz.</hi> That Infant Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did take place as an Ordainance of <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cirſcumciſion</hi> was enjoyned, or the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law Inſtituted, and why then it ſhould ceaſe with it, is more then ever yet could be ſhewn. He makes it appear it was no part of the <hi>Typical</hi> Adminiſtration of the old Teſtament;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57924:37"/>but a moral Inſtitution of <hi>God,</hi> even from the beginning of the World. God ever made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the ſeed of the faithful, and the ſeed of the wicked, as viſibly belonging to two ſeveral Kingdoms, the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Sathan, Mal.</hi> 2.15. therefore are they called a <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> and a Holy Seed are Members of the Church, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Subjects of Baptiſm, the Seal of Admiſſion thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Notwithſtanding the Dictates of <hi>H. D.</hi> that the Baptiſm of Believers is the only true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; we ſhall retain our practice in Baptizing our children, and thankfully own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it as a Goſpel-priviledge, till the oppoſers thereof can produce ſome clear proof out of Scripture, that the Old Ordinance of the Church-Memberſhip of Believers is repealed. We ſee how imperiouſly another ſort of people do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their conceits, and how confidently they call for our ſubſcription to their <hi>Light</hi> as they term it, as if it were a duty to deliver up our <hi>Reaſon</hi> captive to their abſurd imaginations. We reſpect Antipaedobaptiſts as a more ſober people, yet ſtrangely over-grown with ſelf-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if the word of God came out from them, and it came to them only in regard of the true knowledge of the ſpirits mind in it.— Let them produce but one plain Scripture that. God hath made void the Antient Charter and Grant, and we will readily yield up the cauſe. But we have Scripture and reaſon, as well as they, and are the more confirmed in what we hold by obſerving how weakly they diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57924:38"/>
               <p>All the Reaſon the <hi>Author</hi> brings to make good his Aſſertion is,— <hi>Becauſe under the New Teſtament diſpenſation, Chriſt hath appointed the Church to be a ſeparated people out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſiſting only of the ſpiritual ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and therefore believers only upon profeſſion of faith are to be admitted to Baptiſm, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, That under the New Teſtament-Diſpenſation, Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Church to be a ſeparated people out of the <hi>Nations,</hi> is a certain truth; but that this <hi>Church</hi> conſiſts only of the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is falſe. <hi>Qui benè diſtinguit, benè docet, He that diſtinguiſheth well, teacheth well.</hi> What our Antagoniſt ſays is true, in regard of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Myſtical</hi> Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of real Saints, that have ſpiritual Union and Communion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but not ſo with reſpect to the <hi>outward viſible</hi> Church, which is the Society of thoſe that profeſs true faith, for the exerciſe of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> among themſelves, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe are Hypocrits and ſhall periſh.

And <hi>ſuch,</hi> ſaith he, was the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> wherein all held not Communion for life, and of ſuch <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpèaks, Joh. 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit.</hi> And hath theſe words in Oppoſition to what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> falſely chargeth on Proteſtants, <hi>viz.

By all which it is evident that the Author ſtragles out of the Road of Proteſtant Divines, and is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the confines of <hi>Thomas Colliers General Epiſtles.</hi> or the wild Notion of Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> who in his Book intituled, <hi>The way of Peace, pag.</hi> 6. gives this definition of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> The New Teſtament-Church is a ſpiritual Inviſible Fellowſhip gathered up into the Unity of Faith, Hope, and Love, and ſaith, it is no outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſociety gathered together into the conſent and uſe of outward Forms and Worſhip. Now although both are out, yet I acknowledge the <hi>Author</hi> is more ſober then <hi>Dell,</hi> for he is for an External Viſible Church under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Diſpenſation; for he tells us, <hi>Believers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the profeſſion of faith are to be Baptized, and added thereunto,</hi> and yet take him in his own ſence he cannot be excuſed from error and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, for by <hi>Believers,</hi> he means the <hi>Spiritual ſeed</hi> before mentioned, not ſuch as are <hi>Believers</hi> Equivocally, or Analogically, by profeſſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in reality, or truth, as appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words [upon Profeſſion of Faith, by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57924:39"/>Ordinance of Baptiſm were added to the Church] As if when mention is made in the <hi>Acts</hi> of ſo many thouſands that believed, it did imply they were all of the Spiritual Seed Regenerated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Annanias, Saphira, Symon magus,</hi> [who is ſaid to believe;] whereas it denotes no more then a viſible profeſſion of faith, which is all that the Apoſtles and Primitive Churches had cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of, and this is ſeen in Hypocrits who are not the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And this <hi>H. D.</hi> might have learnt as well as other things from Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> who in his Examen, pag 159. tells us, <hi>Profeſſion of Faith and holyneſs is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warrant to Baptiſm.</hi> And in good earneſt one would think (by obſerving the lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of ſome of their Proſelytes) they took them in upon eaſier terms.</p>

                  </note> We further argue, That if none but the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> be the ſubjects of Baptiſm, then viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or ſuch as make a profeſſion of Faith are not the Subjects of Baptiſm; for they may not be more the ſpiritual ſeed; <hi>i.e.</hi> Godly, then infants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay according to this Reaſoning none muſt be Baptized at all, for who can tell who are the ſpiritual ſeed, who belong to Chriſt according to Election and ſaving Faith. Nor will that eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerve their turn, we have charitable ground to believe they are ſuch, becauſe of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is enough to ſatisfie the Church; for if according to the <hi>Author</hi> the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Church is made up only of a ſpiritual ſeed,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57924:39"/>it is neceſſary the Church ſhould not only have a judgement of charity, but infallibility to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who are the ſpiritual ſeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſince the <hi>Author</hi> and thoſe of his way diſclaim all pretence to Infallibility, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the judgment of charity, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the ſpiritual ſeed, knowing nothing to the contrary, <hi>Hanc veniam petimus,</hi> pray give us leave to act a like charity towards the children of Believers. For firſt, they may be capable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Election, <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſuch a one in his Mothers Womb, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11, Neither was it his ſingular priviledge, but what is common to all that are Objects of Election, which is free without reſpect to any thing wrought or to be wrought. 2. They may be capable of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Chriſt himſelf whilſt in the Womb is termed <hi>[The Holy thing]</hi> which proves the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Infants makes them not incapable of grace, ſuppoſing Gods will, and it ſhews God would have it ſo, that ſome of them ſhould be ſanctified becauſe Chriſt paſſed through each age to ſanctifie it to us.<note place="margin">Ideo per omnem venit aetatem, &amp; infantibus infans factus ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans Infantes, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulis parvulus ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficans hanc ipſam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentes aetatem, ſimnl &amp; exemplum illis pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis effectus, &amp; juſtitiae, &amp; ſ bjectionis.</note> As <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that lives neer the Apoſtles, ſpeaks; <hi>John</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and what is that but the graces of the ſpirit, although he was no more enabled to exert or put forth any act of Grace, then he was able to put forth an act of reaſon, nevertheleſs his ſoul wanted not the faculty of reaſon, from his Mothers Womb; and what
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57924:40"/>though we may not ſay all Infants of Believers are a like filled with the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>John</hi> was, yet may we truly ſay that are all as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof as <hi>John.</hi> 3. They are alſo capable of Glory, of Salvation, or elſe it would be ſad, but Chriſt hath told us of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven; that is, Specifically as you ſhall ſee proved hereafter. 4. God calls them holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and ſo may we. By what hath been ſaid I ſuppoſe it is evident to the impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> that the Infants of Believers are as much the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as viſible profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing believers, and we have as much ground if not more, to look upon them as ſuch, as we have for grown Chriſtians, untill they manifeſt the contrary; for as for the former we own them as Godly, and admit them into the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>own</hi> Teſtimony only in a viſible profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which may be deceitful; but the Infants of Believers are taken into Covenant with their Parents, and are viſible Church-Members, and hereby come to have right to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>For the two former, we have an expreſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimony, and that they were once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch, and the Covenant being the ſame as to the eſſential ſpiritual priviledges of it, none of which can be made appear to be repealed; It will follow that Believers Children muſt not be denyed the ſign and ſeal of the Covenant, they having altogether as warrantable a Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as <hi>grown Chriſtians</hi> or Believers.

               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Though the Jews had right to circumciſion, as</hi> Abrahams <hi>natural ſeed under the old Teſtament, yet this would not ſerve the turn under the new,</hi> Mat. 3.9. John <hi>Baptiſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth them of that priviledge</hi> (<hi>of</hi> Abrahams Natural Seed) <hi>that admitted into the Old Church, from any ſuch right in the new.

               <p>And muſt we take all this for Goſpel? We ſhall upon examination find no weight in it, and nothing prejudicial to the Baptizing the children of Believers. For</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57924:41"/>then ſome thouſands of whom he could have no cognizance, as to their fruits of repentance. 2.

It is like he will tell us they confeſſed their ſins, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and ſo were Baptized. But will any man think they did all do ſo, or is it ſaid he baptized no other but ſuch? It will be hard for any man to prove that <hi>John</hi> did impoſe this upon them. We find, as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> notes, that he Baptized them, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But ſince you are not Infallible, let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed you have been miſtaken in your judgment, and have baptized a perſon, which afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

Very good, now you are come about to what I would have; and indeed if the New Teſtament-Church did conſiſt only of the ſpiritual ſeed [real God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones] how abominably is the Ordinance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, when it ſo happens (as it often doth) that any Hypocrites are Baptized, and when it appears that the <hi>Title</hi> which they had to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was but <hi>ſeeming,</hi> will it not follow that all that was done in reference to them was a Male-Adminiſtration, and <hi>Null ab initio;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Covenant ſealed.</note> and as God looks upon them as unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (though they have been dipt) ſo ought the Church to look upon them, and if theſe Hypocrits ſhall repent and be converted, are they not bound to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a-freſh to Baptiſm, and can the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them, and thus according to the <hi>Authors</hi> principle there will be need of a Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſms.</p>
               <p>He concludes this Chapter with the ſayings of two <hi>Doctors</hi> as wide in judgement from each other as the two Poles, yet it ſeems he can make them meet to ſerve his purpoſe. The firſt is Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> who is much engaged for his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but nothing at all for wreſting his ſentences from his intention. 'Tis well known the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. (like to the reſt of his Brethren of the <hi>Congregational way</hi>) is a zealous Aſſertor of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57924:42"/>and the import of what he ſays in his Catechiſme, is no more then what all Congregational men hold; namely, That the matter of the Church is a Society or Fellowſhip of viſible Saints, and this, according to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular dexterity of this Antagoniſt, (who beats us ſtill with our own Weapons) is found to be point blank againſt Infant-Baptiſm. But we ſhall clear this point in the next Chapter, under which it falls properly to be ſpoken of. The other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is Dr. <hi>Taylor:</hi> we have ſaid enough of him before, how much he was for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, notwithſtanding he plays the Orator, and tells us he will act the part of an Anabaptiſt, and ſhew what may be ſaid for them though they are in an Errour; but let us hear what he ſays, for according to the <hi>Author</hi> he doth rarely accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date that which he thinks is truth, when as it is only by beſtowing a few complements upon an error; we ſhall ſeldom meet with ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of affected words, delivered in ſuch a ſtrain as did notably fuit with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the times when he writ them; that is, before the turn of times, when men were high flown, and above Ordinances. <hi>The Baptiſm of Children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is an outward duty, a work of the Law, a Carnal Ordinance; it makes us adhere to the Letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the ſpirit, to be ſatisfied with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, to return to Bondage, to relinquiſh the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriouſneſs, the ſubſtance, the ſpirituality of the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. This is brave ſtuff indeed, high towring language; I never met with the like, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were in Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his ſhadows flying away, and beams of Glory. And is not the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57924:43"/>Baptiſm of Believers think you bravely acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with theſe Rhetorical Flowers? Is there one grain of Logick or Reaſon in all he ſaith? And then at laſt the Doctor doth ſo well accommodate that which <hi>H.D.</hi> calls the truth, that he attempts to maintain it by two groſs errors delivered in one breath; for, ſaith he, if the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery goes not before the <hi>Symbol,</hi> yet it always accompanies it, but never follows it in order of time. But firſt I would fain know who told the <hi>Doctor</hi> that Grace always accompanies Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme? (for that I take to be the plain Engliſh of <hi>Myſtery</hi> and <hi>Symbol</hi> without the help of a <hi>Dictionary.</hi>) No doubt he learnt this good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the Schoolmen, who maintain, that Baptiſm conferrs grace: We may know the mind of them all by that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Suarez,</hi>

By Baptiſme grace is given, if any man be rightly diſpoſed to receive the effect of Baptiſme, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that he receives Baptiſm he ſhall receive grace.</hi> Theſe men ſpeak as if they were acquainted with the Cabinet Councel of Heaven. They can tell (if you will believe them) the <hi>Punctum temporis,</hi> the very moment when the ſpirit will breathe, and quicken a ſoul. And then again the Doctor is as peremptory in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows — <hi>Grace,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>never follows Baptiſm,</hi> which at firſt found is enough to ſcare tender ſouls from medling with it; for if the Doctor
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57924:43"/>ſays true, you that are for Dipping upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, look well to your ſelves: for, if you have not grace when you are baptized, you are never like to have it afterward; grace, ſaith he, never follows it, you are like to live and die graceleſs.</p>
               <p>This we deny not but God may (if he pleaſe) make uſe of Baptiſm to confer grace; but look upon it as a Popiſh errour, that grace is in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annext to it, and a groſſer one that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme confers grace <hi>ex opere operato.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients themſelves as highly as they ſpeak of it, did not hold that grace was an inſeperable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of it. <hi>Auſtin lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Donatiſtas,</hi> hath this ſaying — <hi>Quid prodeſt Baptiſmum,</hi> &amp;c. What profits Baptiſm to them that receive it, unleſs they be inwardly changed? And yet though it may not profit at the preſent, yet it may for the future, and not only the <hi>Adult,</hi> but Infants too may receive good by it.</p>
               <p>To conclude this, I ſhall oppoſe to what the Doctor ſpeaks in derogation of Infant-Baptiſm, the judgement of a more Orthodox Divine, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers,</hi> who ſpeaks more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thus — I ſee no cauſe to deny that even in, and at, and by the Act of Baptiſme the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may imprint grace on the ſoul of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing his ſixth Argument, That Believers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is the only true Baptiſm, from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Primitive Churches, which were not <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> formed of ignorant Babes, but profeſſing men and women, with an anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEſt we ſhould contend in the dark, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we agree upon the terms. By [Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution] muſt be meant the eſſential nature of the primitive Church, and in this I ſuppoſe we are one; and whereas he ſaith theſe Churches were not formed of ignorant Babes, that is, of thoſe alone; for ſo we muſt underſtand him, in regard of the Antitheſis which follows, <hi>viz.</hi> [but of Men and Women] it is very true, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches were not of this <hi>make,</hi> that is, formed only of ignorant Babes; for if they had, they would have been but ſorry Churches. But whatever ſence his words may bear, we know his meaning is, that Children are not included as Church-Members in the Conſtitution of the New Teſtament-Churches, theſe being formed (as he imagines) altogether of profeſſing men and women; which he attempts to prove by <hi>Chriſts Commiſſion, where Teaching goes before Baptizing: By the practice of the Apoſtles in planting Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and by the Dedications and Contents of the Epiſtles,</hi> &amp;c. To which I reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we muſt mind the <hi>Author</hi> with what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57924:44"/>is before ſaid in the firſt chapter, namely, That the import of Chriſts Commiſſion to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was, <hi>de Eccleſia colligendâ,</hi> to direct them how, and in what manner they ſhould gather Churches; they being at firſt ſent out to preach only to ſuch as were <hi>Aliens</hi> in reſpect of the New Adminiſtration: And we acknowledge all perſons under ſuch a Circumſtance, are to be Taught before they are to be Baptized, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church. But in <hi>Eccleſia col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectâ,</hi> a Church actually gathered, wherein there are Infants, the Caſe alters; for ſuch are to be eſteemed as <hi>Portions</hi> of their Parents, as being one with them in a moral account, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church, of which their Parents are Members. And to avoid repetition, the ſame anſwer may ſerve for what is urged from the example and practice of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in planting the New Teſtament-Churches at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Samaria, Act.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Caeſarea, Act.</hi> 10.47, 48. <hi>Philippi, Acts.</hi> 16.14. and elſewhere. But I muſt follow him, having to deal with a ſort of people, who take all of theirs, which is not particularly anſwered, for unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By which Scriptures</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it manifeſtly appears, that the New Teſtament-Churches were formed only of Baptized Believers, wherein we neither find one ignorant Babe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But what demonſtration doth he bring to make this good? The Argument (if he had us'd any) muſt have run in form thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we have no examples of any other that were Members of Churches, under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Diſpenſation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57924:45"/>but profeſſing believers, then no others are to be accounted Church-Members but <hi>ſuch:</hi> But we have no examples of any other, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Major propoſition is unſound, and the Minor propoſition is falſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The conſequence is not ſound; for, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be granted under the Goſpel, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes no mention of any childrens being Church-Members: Yet to conclude from thence there were none, is no good argumentation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mention is made of the Apoſtles taking in profeſſing men and women into the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. to argue thence that therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch belonged not to the Church, is childiſh arguing. But this is a more Maſculine, or Logical way of argumentation, namely, The children of the faithful were Members of the Church before <hi>Moſes</hi> time, before the law, and why not after <hi>Moſes,</hi> now under the Goſpel? God took them into his Covenant with their Parents, and for the ſpace of 2000 years, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they were Church-Members, and ſince Chriſt is come in the fleſh, we find not this gracious Ordinance repealed. There is not the leaſt hint of any ſuch thing in the New Teſtament, therefore it is not repealed, and the children of Believers continue Members ſtill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Minor alſo is falſe; for we have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given us, that the children of Believers are Church-Members, and the Apoſtle writes to them as <hi>ſuch,</hi> as appears <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p>And to make this yet more evident, I ſhall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57924:45"/>produce an Argument or two. The firſt ſhall be that of Mr. <hi>Baxter, in his plain Scripture-proof of Infant Church-Memberſhip, and Baptiſm,</hi> viz. If God have repealed the ordinance, and revoked this merciful gift of Infants Church-Memberſhip, then it is either in mercy or in juſtice, either for their good, or for their hurt. But he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repealed it in mercy for their good, nor in juſtice for their hurt, Therefore he hath not at all repealed it.</p>
               <p>The ſufficiency of the enumeration in the major Propoſition, even Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> himſelf could not deny in that famous diſpute at <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminſter;</hi> for it muſt needs be for the good or hurt of Infants that they are put out; and ſo muſt needs be in mercy, or juſtice; for God maketh not ſuch great alterations in his Church and Laws to no end, and of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in meer indifferency.</p>
               <p>The minor, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> proves in both parts: 1. That God hath not repealed this to their hurt in juſtice: for, if God never revoke his Mercies, nor repeal his Ordinances in juſtice to the parties hurt, till they firſt break Covenant with him, and ſo procure it by their own deſert; then he hath not in juſtice revoked his mercy, to the hurt of thoſe that never broke Covenant with him. But it is certain God never revoketh a mercy in juſtice to the hurt of any that never broke Covenant with him: Therefore to ſuch he hath not revoked it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Church-Memberſhip is a mercy, and of the Covenant, is plain: <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God doth not in juſtice revoke ſuch to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57924:46"/>any, but Covenant-breakers, may be proved. 1. From the merciful nature, and conſtant deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, who never caſteth off thoſe that caſt not off him. 2. From his truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, for elſe we ſhould make God the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaker, and not man, which is horrid blaſphemy. 3. His Immutability and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his gifts and calling being without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now this is alſo certain that many Jews did believe and not forſake the Covenant of God, even moſt of the Apoſtles themſelves, and many thouſands more: and how then can theſe or their Infants be put out of the Church in juſtice to their hurt, who did not firſt break Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God. Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> was hard put to it, how to extricate himſelf from the difficulties of this Argument, although a man of great Dexterity, and a very <hi>Oedipus</hi> in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, yet it is ſaid he was near to <hi>a nè plus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà,</hi> but at length took Sanctuary in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and mark it well, Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> [That the Ordinance was in mercy repealed for their good.] To which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives a neat reply — It can be no mercy, to take away a mercy, except it be to give a greater inſtead of it: But here is no greater mercy given to Infants inſtead of Church-memberſhip: Therefore it can be no mercy to them that it is revoked.</p>
               <p>Other Arguments beſides this, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, may be drawn from that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. A Scripture, which I perceive was too hot for the <hi>Authors</hi> fingers to meddle with, and therefore he gives not one touch upon it, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all this Treatiſe of Baptiſm; whereas he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57924:46"/>knows very well, that this is the principal Text that gives clear evidence that Children are yet Church-members with their parents; and if they have a Church-relation, they muſt not be denyed Baptiſm: becauſe the ſame thing which qualifies any perſons for Church-memberſhip, qualifies them alſo for Baptiſm. But to the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
               <p>There are three things which the words do plainly hold forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though the Collective body of the Jews or the generality of that people were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the Church through unbelief, yet all of them were not broken off; for it is ſaid, [If ſome of them were broken off] not all of them: for as was ſaid before, moſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and thouſands of Jews believed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Believing Gentiles are ingrafted in their place — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in amongſt them,</hi> ſo <hi>Grotius</hi> hath it, <hi>poſitus es inter ramos illius arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, thou art ſet amongſt the branches of the Tree,</hi> referring to thoſe words, <hi>if ſome be broken off.</hi> implying that ſome remained ſtill, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles were inoculated amongſt them, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> according to <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piſcator, pro ipſis,</hi> inſtead of them, or in their place and room, <hi>in ramorum defractorum locum, into the place of the branches broken off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Jews ſhall be reſtored again to the Church at the latter end of the world, they ſhall be in <hi>ſtatu quo priùs,</hi> become the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God again, as formerly, but in a more glorious manner. From all which iſſueth three unanſwerable Arguments for the Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57924:47"/>of believers Infants ſtill continued.</p>
               <p>The firſt we have already inſiſted upon, namely, That the ſame Jewiſh children which were viſibly of the Church immediately before their Parents became Chriſtians at the firſt, continued to be ſo after. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not under the diſ-churching Cauſe of as many of the Jews as were diſcharged, and that was unbelief, of which they could not be guilty by any Act of their own,<note place="margin">More of this may be ſeen in a late Book called A Perſwaſive to Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among Chriſtians. Sold at the <hi>Three Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> in <hi>Cornhil.</hi>
                  </note> or of their Parents, as imputed to them. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> they were broken off. If it be ſaid (ſaith the Author of that ingenious and pious piece, intituled <hi>A Perſwaſive to Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi>) they were diſ-church'd in the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Jewiſh Church-State in general: it is but an evaſion which will not help them: for the fore-cited Text is flatly againſt them. For all that <hi>were</hi> not broken off by unbelief, did continue unbroken off; that is, they ſtill kept their place and ſtanding in the Church of God. And therefore to aſſign any other cauſe of diſ-churching any, than the Scripture hath aſſigned; or at leaſt, any other without this here aſſigned, and determined by the Apoſtle, is too great preſumption, and ſuch as will not ſatisfie an impartial mind; and, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> enforceth the Argument very ſtrongly, They who kept their Station, kept alſo their priviledges for themſelves, and their children, if they were not broken off, their children were not broken off;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57924:47"/>for, as the Infants came in with their Parents, ſo they are not caſt out whilſt their Parents conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, except when they are grown up they caſt out themſelves by their own perſonal unbelief. It is not to be conceived, that God ſhould caſt out the child that came in for his fathers ſake, while the Parents remain in the ſame Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe Jews who were broken off from the Church, their children alſo being before Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, were likewiſe broken off; therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Believing Gentiles and their children are ingrafted in: for the ingrafting muſt be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the breaking off; they ſucceeding in the place of the former, muſt enjoy the priviledge they loſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If after the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, the Jews ſhall be grafted in again, not with a diminution, but addition to their glory, and one part of their glory was, that they and their ſeed were Gods viſible Church, then ſo ſhall it be with them when they are called. This we have <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Which cannot be underſtood but from their broken off State, they ſhall be grafted into the Church again as before; for as Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> notes in his <hi>Defence of Infant Baptiſm, pag.</hi> 134. At their firſt grafting in, they and their children were grafted in: at their caſting out, they and their children were broken off; and when they ſhall be taken in again, they and their children ſhall be taken in. This Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> himſelf grants, that the Jews and their ſeed were rejected together, yea, and that they ſhall be taken in together, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. of his anſwer.</p>
               <p>Thus then we argue, if it muſt be ſo with them,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57924:48"/>it muſt be ſo with believing Gentiles now, or elſe there will be a Schiſme between Jew and Gentile in point of priviledges; elſe there will be too diſtinct eſtates in the Chriſtian Churches; one of the Jews, holy Fathers and children; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Gentiles, who have only perſonal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, none for their ſeed, which is an abſurd conceit (as Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> ſpeaks) and would ſet up or keep up a partition-wall ſtill, contrary to that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. I ſhall ſay nothing of other abſurdities, which are very numerous, which come from the denying the Church-Memberſhip of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſeed of believers.</p>
               <p>The Author adds; <hi>It is incongruous to reaſon and ſenſe to imagine, that little Children are any way concerned as Church Members, either in the Dedications of the Epiſtles ſent to the Churches, or the Epiſtles themſelves, for they were dedicated to thoſe who were called to be Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that this is a meer <hi>Paralogiſm;</hi> for what if we confeſs the Apoſtle directed his Epiſtles to ſuch as were profeſt Believers and Saints by calling, were none other but thoſe, or ſuch like them, concern'd in the Epiſtles? What ſhall we think of carnal perſons and unbelievers, are they unconcerned in them? This minds me with a paſſage in Mr. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſerious Reflections, ſuch another rigid <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> as our <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt.</hi> He tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 9. That the Epiſtles were writ to particular Churches, and that it will be difficult to prove they were alſo directed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Saints; but ſaith <hi>Bunian,</hi> a more moderate man (although an <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi>) If this be true, there is vertue indeed, and more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57924:48"/>I dreamed of in partaking of Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. For if that ſhall take away the Epiſtles, and conſequently the whole Bible, from all that are not Baptized (he means, after their mode of dipping, being grown Chriſtians) then are the other Churches and alſo particular Saints in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deplorable condition. Would to God (ſaith he of his Brethren) they had learnt more modeſty then thus to take from all others,<note place="margin">Nè autem exiſtiment Corinthii, hanc Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, ita ipſis propriam eſſe, ut ad alios non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineat; addit, Cumomni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus qui invocant nomen Domini noſtri Jeſus Chriſti in quovis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co tum ipſorum tum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri. <hi>Piſcator</hi> in locum.</note> and appropriate to themſelves, and that for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a circumſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he better inſtructs Mr. <hi>Paul,</hi> and turns him to St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 16.5. and to the firſt Epiſtle written to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and ſhews that the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> was wrote to ſome who at that time were out of Fellowſhip, that they might have fellowſhip with the Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we grant the Epiſtles were directed (ſome of them) to profeſſing Believers joyn'd in Fellowſhip, <hi>directly and immediately,</hi> and to their children (if they had any) and the children of all Believers in ſucceeding ages, <hi>remotely;</hi> and the contents of the Epiſtles concern both the Parents at preſent, and the children when come to years of diſcretion. A Father that hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral children, ſome grown up to underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others Minors or Babes, may direct a Book or Epiſtle to them all. Whatſoever was writ, was written as much for our inſtruction as the Primitive Chriſtians, We know <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57924:49"/>the Prophets directed what they writ to the Church under that Adminiſtration, whereof their Children were a part, and yet they were ignorant Babes, and could not underſtand any thing or perform any duties. But let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that though they underſtood nothing of thoſe divine Exhortations, yet being within Gods Nurſery and School, they were in a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capacity to be taught their duty, than <hi>Aliens;</hi> and their Parents were injoyned to teach them the Ordinances of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> gave this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he knew he would teach his children: and in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it was the commendation of <hi>Lois,</hi> that ſhe had inſtructed <hi>Timothy</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Some of thoſe titles may be predicated of children, ſome not.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Nor are they only foederally holy, but they may be alſo inherently ſanctified, ſaith Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> in his <hi>Examen.</hi> They may receive the new birth, and we ſay more, they muſt receive it, if ſaved, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.5.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57924:50"/>and in them that have the uſe of Reaſon: beſides that this (as the Learned Doctor ſpeaks) is wholly againſt the <hi>Analogy</hi> of à <hi>New-birth,</hi> in which the perſon to be born is wholly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and hath put into him the Principle that in time will produce its proper Actions. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they <hi>can receive</hi> the new birth, and are capable of it. The effect of it is ſalvation, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants can receive this effect, then alſo the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, without which they cannot receive the effect; and he illuſtrates the point by a Similitude thus.</p>
               <p>As the reaſonable ſoul and all its faculties are in children, <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>

So may the ſpirit of grace, the principle of Chriſtian life be infuſed, and yet lie without action, till in its own day it is drawn forth — and then he goes on — Who is he that underſtands the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſo well as to know how or when it is infuſed, and how it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates in all its periods, and what it is in its Being and proper Nature, or how, or to what purpoſe God in all varieties does diſpenſe it?</p>
               <p>Then again, if Nature, ſaith he, hath in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants an <hi>evil principle,</hi> which operates when the child can chooſe, but is all the while within the ſoul; Why cannot Infants have a good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

               <p n="4">4. Though Infants are uncapable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch duties as are incumbent upon profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men and women, yet this hinders not but that they may be Church-Members. Pray tell us what duties could thoſe Iſraelitiſh Babes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, who notwithſtanding their incapacity, were, asis before, Members of the Church with their Parents. And though they anſwer not all the Characters <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives his Adult Diſciples (which the Author objects againſt them) yet they are capable of union to the Church, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the priviledges thereof. They are capable of her prayers and other pious offices, and for whom the Church hath a more ſpecial care and obligation of tenderneſs for their ſouls, than for others that are <hi>Without;</hi> and why ſhould this ſeem ſtrange? ſince they are Members of the Common-wealth, and of the family, and are capable of union with both eſtates, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof, and yet cannot perform obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the State and Orders of either. In like ſort, Infants are admitted Tenants, but the Fealty or Homage is reſpited till they are of age.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> notes) was head of the Church, according to his humane nature in his infancy, and this proves that the nonage of Infants makes them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57924:51"/>not uncapable of being Members. And let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny judge whether it be his will that no Infants ſhould be Members. For my part, ſaith he, when I conſider that Infant State of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our head, and the honour done to him therein, it ſtrongly perſwades me that they know not his will, who ſay they will not have Infants to be viſible Members.</p>
               <p>He farther Objects the <hi>Church of England, who in their 19th. Artiele do acknowledge that the viſible Church is a number of Chriſtians by profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is down right Mr. <hi>Tombs's Examen, part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 41. only <hi>Tombes</hi> hath more charity for the Infants of Believers, though not without ſome contradiction. For he there acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>in facie Eccleſiae viſibilis,</hi> Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are to be accounted <hi>Gods, to belong to his Family and Church, and not the Devils;</hi> And what do any of us ſay more? But mark Reader how Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> doth eſteem them ſuch; why, ſaith he, it is ſo, as being in a near poſſibility of being Members of the Church of God, by an act of opinion grounded on probable hopes for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But to make them actual members of the viſible Church is to overthrow the definitions of the viſible Church, that Proteſtant writers give, particularly the Church of <hi>England, Art.</hi> 19. To which Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> anſwers, If overthrows it not at all for <hi>they</hi> all include the Infants of ſuch Profeſſors; as Infants <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:57924:51"/>too (leaſt you ſay that Circumciſion made them Members:) I add alſo ſaith he, Baptiſme now (as well as Circumciſion of old) is a <hi>real,</hi> though <hi>implicite</hi> profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>Next we have Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> (whom he cites no leſs than four times in what follows in this Chapter) whoſe judgement is ſufficiently known to be againſt our Oppoſites. And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the miſinterpretation the <hi>Author</hi> puts upon ſome paſſages in the Doctors Catechiſme, we have a particular account of his judgment in Print, in a Book called, <hi>A Declaration of the Faith and Order owned and practiſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches agreed upon and conſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by their Elders and Meſſengers in their meeting at the</hi> Savoy, Octob. 12. 1658. where to my knowledge he was preſent, and the principal man of that Aſſembly, and concerning the point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we have it chap, 29. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, <hi>viz. Not only thoſe that do actually profeſs Faith in and obedience unto Chriſt, but alſo the Infants of one or both believing Parents are to be Baptized, and thoſe only.</hi> And in complyance herewith, we have the judgment of the <hi>Synod</hi> of Elders Aſſembled at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> appointed by the <hi>Court,</hi> 1662. who ſtrongly maintain by ſeveral Arguments in that printed piece, <hi>That the Inſant Seed of Believers are Church-Members, and that being according to Scripture, Members of the viſible Church, they are conſequently the Subjects of Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57924:52"/>
               <p>See alſo the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgement upon the point in the larger Catechiſme of the Aſſembly of Divines. <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to any that are out of the viſible Church, and ſo ſtrangers to the Covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, till they profeſs their Faith in Chriſt, and obdeience to him. But Infants deſcending from Parents, either both or but one of them profeſſing Faith in Chriſt and obedience to him, are in that reſpect within the Covenant, and to be Baptized.</hi> we ſee here who they take to be of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and within the Covenant, and to be baptized.</p>
               <p>As for the Authority of particular Authors we have them on our ſide in great abundance. <hi>Piſcator</hi> hath it thus on the 28. of <hi>Matthew; Porrò ad Eccleſiam pertinent non ſolùm adulti, fidem profitentes, ſed etiam ipſorum liberi; Not only grown perſons who profeſs the Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Church, but alſo their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Divines fall in with the reſt, I will name but one, <hi>inſtàr omnium,</hi> and that is the famous Doctor <hi>

               <p>To conclude this, I cannot but pitty the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> becauſe of that ſelf-conceited ſcornful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that appears in what follows, altogether unbecoming a Chriſtian; and I think all modeſt and ſober ſpirits, cannot but be extreamly ſcandalized to ſee a man (pretending to be for the truth of Chriſt) ſo proudly to trample upon all that differ from him. Surely he muſt needs be furniſht with more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meaſure of ſelf-conceit, that doth ſo Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially condemn not only the <hi>Ancients,</hi> but thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reformation of latter days, ſparing none, neither <hi>Prelate, Presbyter,</hi> nor <hi>Independent.</hi> Have patience Reader, and thou ſhalt hear a little of it.</p>

               <p>Have a care Sir, ſince you ſwell at this rate leaſt you burſt. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells you <hi>Eccleſia ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per habuit ſemper tenuit, The Church always had it, always held Infant Baptiſme.</hi> And Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> a perſon whom you ſeem to honour much, ſays there is no Record extant of any Church in the World, that from the Apoſtles days in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to this very day, ever refuſed to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize children, excepting of late amongſt your ſelves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This of the ſix hundred years giving the Communion to Infants, he hath taken from Maſter <hi>Tombes</hi> his ſixth Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſme, Exercitation, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. for there it is, and <hi>Tombes</hi> as is conceived took it up from <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Jeſuite, who reports that the giving of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to Infants continued ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years in the Church. But Maſter <hi>Geree</hi> well òbſerves, that is not, nor ought to be taken of the firſt ſix hundred years, for it appears. by <hi>Maldonate</hi>'s expreſſion, calling it <hi>Sententiam,</hi> the opinion of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> that it had, if not its riſe, yet its force to become common from them. Not only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants but Papiſts themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that of communicating Infants
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57924:54"/>as an errour, yea (as I remember) the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf. And yet Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> doth profeſs in his diſcourſe of Baptizing the Infants of Believers; that, <hi>page</hi> 59. certainly there is infinitely more reaſon why Infants may be communicated then why they may not be Baptized.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtant Reformers are more blind, and do worſe in his opinion then thoſe who gave Infants the Lords Supper —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And how much worſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Proteſtant Reformers, that ſo lamentalby miſs it, both in the due Order and right Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects alſo, which the Prelate and Presbyter doe in admitting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Baptiſm and Memberſhip, but not to the Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little more modeſtly would do the Author no hurt, and let him know, that neither their Baptiſm or Church-Memberſhip, are inconſiſtent with the Word, but ſo is Infant-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57924:54"/>, not only becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a particular qualification to the Ordinance which Infants are not capable of, namely, the exerciſe of actual grace in <hi>examination, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Body, and remembring the death of Chriſt;</hi> but becauſe they are not capable in any certain way of the Elements uſed in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to take and eat the Bread, and drink Wine.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this <hi>Hagio-Maſtix</hi> laſheth the <hi>Independents, which do worſe than all the reſt, and doth more groſly erre in point of Order, in admitting them to Baptiſm, but neither to Memberſhip nor the Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I find the Proverb is true, <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia,</hi> even that great Doctor called Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> is ignorant of ſome things.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I crave leave of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> tó tell him he is ignorant of the grounds or principles by which the Independents walk. And for his

                  <p>HE ſaith, the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> tell us, that they find nothing in this Century different from the former, that is in reference to Baptiſm: And that they make mention of <hi>Juſtin Martyr's</hi> words, in his Apology to <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> the Emperour, which are repeated as we have it tranſlated by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Saints Reſt.</hi> The import of which is only to ſhew what order they took with <hi>Pagans,</hi> upon their converſion to the Chriſtian Faith, before they were admitted to the Sacraments.

Nor do I ſee any reaſon he hath to pick a quarrel with our Practice, from any thing in that Fathers Apologie, who, (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> notes) giveth ſuch hints, by which his Judgment and the Practice of the Church in thoſe days may be diſcerned to be for it, though we cannot expect that he ſhould ſpeak expreſly to the point, both becauſe he is brief, and treateth on other Theams, to which this did not belong, and becauſe the Church then living among Heathens, had ſo much to do in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Baptizing the Aged, that they had little occaſion to treat about Children; eſpecially it being a point not controverted, but taken for granted by the Chriſtians, who knew God's dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> that Children were Members with the Converted Parents; eſpecially when the very Gentiles Children were members before <hi>Chriſt:</hi> With more to this purpoſe. <hi>Plain Scripture-proof, Pag.</hi> 155.</p>

We may judge what credit to give him by theſe following inſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> he perverts the ſaying of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as if it were directed againſt Infant-Baptiſm, when meant only of Infidels, who according to Chriſts Commiſſion muſt firſt be taught, then Baptized.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57924:64"/>
                     <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was for Infant-Baptiſm and it was Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in his days,<note place="margin">Athan, ad Antioch. qu. <hi>114.</hi>
                     </note> as appears by that paſſage of his to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus 114th</hi> Queſtion; Where he reſolves a doubt that might ariſe from the death of Infants, whether they go to Heaven or no. — ſeeing, ſaith he, the Lord ſaid, <hi>Suffer little Children to come to me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Now your Children are Holy, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Infants of Believers which are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, do as unſpotted and faithful enter into the Kingdom.</hi> Where mark again how unworthily <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> abuſe the Fathers, in ſaying their ſtrongeſt Argument for Childrens Baptiſm is from Tradition, which they fly to for want of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Next he cites <hi>Hilary,</hi> and we are of his mind, that confeſſion and profeſſion is requiſite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Baptizing-<hi>Aliens,</hi> but what is this to exclude the Infants of Believers from that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>
                  <p>And whereas he ſaith the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches did only Baptize the <hi>Adult,</hi> this is abominably falſe. His firſt inſtance is of a ſaying of <hi>Baſil contra Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomium, Lip.</hi> 3. Muſt the Faithful be fealed with Baptiſm-Faith muſt needs precede, and go before.

                  <p>The next is <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> that the Baptized in his time uſed in the firſt place to confeſs their Sins; but I am before hand with them in reſpect of this Ancient Dr. of the Church, and love not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> (ſaith he) adviſed that the Baptiſm of Infants be deferred, quoting it out of Dr. <hi>Taylors Liberty of Propheſy.</hi> Beſides what we have ſaid of <hi>Nazianzens</hi> judgment, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded not Infant Baptiſm as unlawful, but as conceiving delay for three or four Years more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; but if there were <hi>Aliquid periouli,</hi> any fear of death, then he allowed of it: I ſhall mind the Reader that when the Learned Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> brought in <hi>Nazianzen</hi> againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, he perſonated an <hi>Anabaptiſt;</hi> but in his latter diſcourſe you have his Judgment very fully for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm confuting his former piece; &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he quotes the following paſſage out of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57924:65"/>for Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> What wilt thou ſay of Children which neither are ſenſible of the loſs nor the grace? ſhall we Baptize them? yes, by all means in caſe of urgent danger, for it is better to be Sanctified [<hi>i e</hi> Baptized] without their knowledg, than to dye without it; for ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Circumciſed Babes of Iſrael <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I conclude this with what <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſaith of him in his <hi>Theſis de Baptiſmo—non igitur Nazianzenus</hi> &amp;c. Nazianzen was not againſt Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>After him comes <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who in his <hi>3d</hi> Book <hi>de Sacramentis.</hi> Cap. 2. hath this ſaying, <hi>That the Baptized did not only make confeſſion of his Faith, but was to deſire the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I perceive he is ſtill ſick of the old diſeaſe, for that this Father ſpeaks of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> in what order they were taken into the <hi>Church,</hi> and not in Oppoſition to the Baptizing Infants needs no other proof, than that he himſelf was for it. <hi>Quia omnis aetas peccato obnoxia, ideo omnis aetas Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento idonea.

                  <p>There is one or two more, but I will leave them for we have enough of it.</p>
                  <p>After this ſmall Shot, the <hi>Author</hi> lets fly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Decrees of Councils, <hi>for Baptizing ſuch as were of years of diſcretion, and were able to rehearſe the Articles of the Creed; as alſo we have an Enumeration of ſeveral perſons born of Chriſtian Parents, that were not Baptized till they were of Age and able to give account of their Faith.</hi>

                  <p>To which I Reply, <hi>firſt</hi> Grant that ſome <hi>Councils</hi> were againſt Infant-Baptiſm which we ſhall not yeild) yet if we muſt go by number of <hi>Councils,</hi> we ſhall carry it. He names three which he would have thought to be againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and I think I ſhall not exceed in ſaying we may name ten times three for it: and mark Reader, he takes the priviledge of citing Councils, but if we do it, they are ſlighted and condemned for Popiſh and Superſtitious. 2. We conceive thoſe <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> he names, had alſo reſpect to <hi>Pagans</hi> in their Decrees, and we have good reaſon for it: becauſe the Canon of <hi>Neocaeſaria</hi> ſpeaks plainly of the Children of ſuch Women as come out from amongſt Infidels, being proſelyted to the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Religion in their Pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> tells Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This is taken out of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> Exercitation and Examen.</note> when he Objected the ſame thing. The Author hath taken the whole Story out of him and all the reſt upon the matter, which follows in this <hi>Century</hi> is fetcht from his Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Examen printed 27. years ſince, and Anſwered by that Reverend Divine Mr. <hi>Steven Marſhal,</hi> in his Defence of Infant-Baptiſm. I would make a parallel betwixt the Author I have to deal with and <hi>Tombes,</hi> but that it would be tedious, wherefore inſtead of that I will tranſcribe the ſame things out of <hi>Tombes,</hi> which the Author hath brought again upon the Stage: If the Reader compare them he will find, never two Eggs more alike.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in his <hi>Examen</hi> Pag. 10. hath it thus: <hi>Grotius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in his Annotation on Matt.</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57924:66"/>19.14. adds, <hi>That the Canon of the Synod of Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſaria held in the year</hi> 315. <hi>determins that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child might be Baptized, becauſe the Baptiſm reached not the fruit of her womb, becauſe in the Confeſſion made in Baptiſm each ones free choyce is ſhewed. From which Canon</hi> Balſomon <hi>and</hi> Zonaras <hi>do infer, that an Infant cannot be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, becauſe it hath no power to chaſe the Confeſſion of Divine Baptiſm.</hi> This is according to what we have in <hi>H. D.</hi> to a tittle: what impudence then is it to trouble us with this filly and ridiculous Story, when Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> proved to <hi>Tombes</hi> that the inference brought from hence againſt the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Believers Children was altogether inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. For the Canon there ſpeaks of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Women come out from among Infidels, and come over to the Chriſtian Faith, during the time they were with Child. For <hi>Balſomon</hi> ſaith, ſuch Women as were with Child and come from the Infidels, and what is this to our Queſtion? (ſaith Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi>) which is about Children born in the Church of believing Parents; and <hi>Balſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Gloſſator diſtinguiſheth of Children, ſome in the womb and ſome born, for the firſt (faith he) no man can undertake (he means in Baptiſm;) and for the other, they anſwer by ſuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them: which words (as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) are not mentioned by Mr, <hi>Tombes,</hi> (for he ſays no more than what he found in <hi>Grotius,</hi>) and for the partial relation, he is ſharply rebuked for wronging the Truth, and labouring to decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve people, and yet the Author I conflict with perſiſts in the ſame courſe.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57924:66"/>
                  <p>Next the <hi>Author</hi> ſpeaks big words, telling us, <hi>That in farther Aſſurance and Confirmation of this great Truth, we have moſt remarkable Inſtances of ſeveral of the moſt Eminent perſons of this</hi> Century, <hi>that were not Baptized till Aged, though the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Believing Parents, viz.</hi> Bazil, Gregory, Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Chryſoſtom, Auſtin, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> again, <hi>Examen p.</hi> 9. And that People may not be ſtartled with theſe great names,<note place="margin">Reply <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Examen,</hi> P. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> and be made to think, that Childrens Baptiſm, was not practiſed in the Church in thoſe days, wherein they lived, I ſhall acquaint the Reader out of Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> upon what grounds Chriſtians hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deferred their Baptiſm; namely, ſometimes they would do it in imitation of Chriſt who was not Baptized till about thirty years of Age. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great put off his Baptiſm till he came to the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſome deferred it, till they had contracted a great deal of ſin, out of an erroneous conceit, that by Baptiſm it would be all waſhed away: Much more we have of this in <hi>Marſhal</hi>'s <hi>Defence of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> Pag. 27.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Inſtances, I find <hi>Tombes</hi> begins with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and then comes on <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> but the <hi>Author</hi> here ends with <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> This argues nevertheleſs it was taken thence: I ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57924:67"/>trouble my ſelf no further to ſeek after any other reaſon why the Baptiſm of theſe men was delayed than what Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> gives <hi>Tombes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great (though the Son of <hi>Helena,</hi> who is reported to have been a zealous Chriſtian) not Baptized till he was Aged: it doth not appear that his Mother was a Chriſtian when he was born, and for his Father <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> every one knows he was none, though he favoured the Chriſtians. Furthermore, Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> conceives the reaſon why he received not Baptiſm in his Infancy was thus as follows; <hi>viz.</hi> Conſtantine <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, albeit a man of a ſweet temper, and tender of his Subjects: firſt out of the mildneſs of his nature favoured the Chriſtians (ſeeing their unblameable Converſation and Faithfulneſs in all their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) therefore he did not in a hoſtile way purſue their Religion, as other</hi> Emperours <hi>did: yea at length he grew to a good eſteem of it, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his life: in this time his Son</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>the Great, lived in</hi> Diocleſian <hi>his Court, from whence (his life being twice in danger) he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly eſcaping, came to his Father then ſick, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon his death was ſaluted</hi> Emperour. Theſe things conſidered it is no marvel if he were not Baptized in his Infancy, when for ought we read neither of his Parents had then imbraced the Chriſtian Religion: When he was returned at his Father's Death he was thirty years of Age, and whether ever his Father was Baptized, the Story is ſilent. Neither is <hi>Helena</hi> her affection to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57924:67"/>in his Infancy related in the Story, though afterward it is often mentioned.</p>

                  <p>After this we have a plauſible Story of one <hi>Walfridus Strabo</hi> an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtorian, and what is brought from him the Author borrows from his good friend Mr. <hi>Tombes:</hi> you ſhall have it in his very words, that you may know where the Author hath been fiſhing.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57924:69"/>that are born again in Chriſt, and confirms it by</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin<hi>'s own Confeſſion of himſelf, continuing a</hi> Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus <hi>long afore Baptized: but afterwards Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans underſtanding Original Sin</hi> ne perirent parvuli <hi>[Tombes hath it in Latin, but the Author in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh] and leſt Children ſhould periſh without any means of Grace, had them Baptized by the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Africa, <hi>and then adds how God-fathers and God-mothers were invented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I Anſwer, That <hi>Strabo</hi> is condemned by many Learned men, for a falſe and heedleſs Writer, and they have ſhewn his errors in diverſe things. <hi>Voſſius</hi> chargeth him with no ſmall faults in relating matters of Fact. As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Confeſſions tells us, he continued a <hi>Catechumenus</hi> till he was 25 years old. [<hi>Tombes</hi> mentions not this as knowing <hi>Strabo</hi> was out in his reckoning:) Now <hi>Auſtin himſelf</hi> tells us in his Confeſſions, that he was not converted till about the <hi>30th</hi> year of his Age; and after that continued a <hi>Catechized</hi> Perſon two years, and in the <hi>34th</hi> year of his Age, he was Baptized at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> by <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> whereas he makes as if Infant-Baptiſm were an Innovation, &amp; not in uſe in the firſt times, he goes about to prove it very ſimply, from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's</hi> being Baptized at full years: as if <hi>Auſtin's</hi> times had been the firſt times, whereas we have ſhewn before it was in practice many hundred years before he was born; and <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf (that lived many hundred years before <hi>Strabo</hi> was born), af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That the Church always had it; always held it.</hi> It was a ſolid Obſervation of Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> in his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae paedobaptiſmi,</hi> That if the Antiquity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57924:69"/>had been dubious amongſt the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, ſurely ſome of the Latin or Greek <hi>Churches</hi> that held the delay of Baptiſm more convenient, and perſwaded it, would have been the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded againſt the uſe of it, from its Novelty, and given at leaſt ſome hint of that in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I obſerve a pittiful eſcape in <hi>Walfridus Strabo,</hi> who ſaith Infant-Baptiſm took its riſe and foundation afterwards, when Chriſtians came to underſtand Original Sin; and when was that I pray, doth he think never till <hi>Auſtin's</hi> days? I ſuppoſe Chriſtians underſtood this as ſoon as ever Baptiſm was enjoyned; the Scripture is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs touching Original corruption: Nay the very Heathens by the light of Nature knew, that we were Originally depraved, although they could not tell which way it came about, as <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſis</hi> largely ſhews in his <hi>Verity of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> This alſo was ſhadowed forth to the <hi>Jews</hi> in Circumciſion: <hi>In ſin was I conceived</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, &amp;c.</hi> What a ſtrange imagination then is it in this Writer, That the Baptiſm of Infants was an Invention found out in <hi>Auſtin's</hi> time, to waſh away Original Sin, of which Chriſtians till then had been ignorant! It is very true the Fathers were of opinion that it was of uſe for that, and that long before <hi>Auſtin.</hi> They knew Infants were defiled, although they had lived but one day upon Earth as <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Hom.</hi> 8. <hi>in Luk.</hi> although <hi>Origen</hi> miſtakes as to the manner how they came to be defiled. For this fancy of <hi>Strabo,</hi> minds me with another of <hi>Origen's,</hi> a little more extravagant, who thought Baptiſm ſerved to waſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57924:70"/>away thoſe ſins which the Soul was guilty of, whilſt it was in ſome other Body (a Pythagorean fancy,) before it entered into the body of the Child; whence it appears that <hi>Origen</hi> was not for the Traduction of Original Sin from our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but a patron of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſy, (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo called.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Strabo</hi> is much out too about his <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers,</hi> which were in uſe in the Church many hundred years before <hi>Auſtin</hi> was born, even in the <hi>3d</hi> Century in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s days and yet he tells us, they were firſt invented in <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly;</hi> Laſtly this <hi>Srabo</hi> doth at laſt kick down the good pail of Milk, which he before gave our Adverſaries; for declaring his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon the matter he ſaith, that it was a ſign of the growth of Religion after a diligent ſearch) to take up the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, and amongſt other Teſtimonies citeth the Fathers in general for it, in oppoſition to the prolonging of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Baptiſm, till he was <hi>Adult:</hi> And concludes at laſt thus — <hi>Wiſe Chriſtians Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized their Infants, being not as ſome heretical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, oppoſing the Grace of God, and contend that Infants are not to be Baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some others my Antagoniſt brings, and quotes Authors for perſons not Baptized till grown up; which whether true or no, I ſhall not enquire nor undertake to determine of the reaſons why their Baptiſm was delayed, which very likely may be the ſame with thoſe before-mentioned, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes which ſhake not the <hi>Baſis,</hi> upon which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57924:70"/>Infant-Baptiſm is ſetled, nor ſtrike at the general Practice of the Church.</p>

                  <p>HE tells us again, <hi>That in this Age, Believers Baptiſm was Aſſerted, and the grounds thereof by many learned Writers:</hi> and here take notice Reader how egregiouſly he Faulters, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth only in two, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Auſtin:</hi> the former ſaying, <hi>That the time of Grace and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the only fit time for Baptiſm; which was the ſeaſon the three-thouſand were Baptized in the</hi> 2d. of the Acts, <hi>and the five-thouſand afterwards,</hi> Acts 4.</p>
                  <p>The latter, that is <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Book <hi>de fide &amp; bonis Operibus,</hi> Cap. 6. ſaith, <hi>That none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Examination, both as to Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ough to be admitted to Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Quotations the Author ſeems to have forgotten himſelf; for ſee what he ſays in his <hi>Treatiſe Pag.</hi> 121. there he gives an account of the Doctors of this Age [<hi>Cent.</hi> 5.] that approv'd Infant-Baptiſm, the firſt is <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the words cited by him are theſe: <hi>That Infants ought to be Baptized, as univerſally received by the Catholick-Church:</hi> And again, <hi>That which the Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World unanimouſly teacheth and practiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Baptizing of Children, ought not careleſly to be ſlighted.</hi> Magdeburg.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57924:71"/>in his Conteſts both againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and the <hi>Celeſtians;</hi> and then ſets down ſome paſſages out of his works for it: ſo that here we have theſe Fathers (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the account he gives of them) diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to themſelves, and how ſhall we reconcile them? very eaſily, (even as we may do with the ſayings of the reſt:) for when they ſpeak of the Baptizing perſons after examination as to Doctrine and Converſation, they mean <hi>Pagans:</hi> and when they Aſſert Infant-Baptiſm,<note place="margin">The <hi>Fathers</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</note> it is in the behalf of the Children of Believers born in the Church.

                     <hi>IN this Age</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>The</hi> Adult <hi>upon Profeſſion of Faith, were Baptized.</hi> This is no news: and yet 'tis obſervable he gives no inſtance of any ſuch that were Baptized; which if he had, it had been nothing to the purpoſe; unleſs he could have proved that in this Age the judgment of the Church had been againſt Infant-Baptiſm, which is quite otherwiſe: for the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> cite this ſaying of <hi>Maxentius, Propterea recentes ab utero parvulos credimus Baptizari,</hi> that is: We believe Infants newly born are to be Baptized. The Author is ſo ſtreightned in this Century, that he knows not well what to ſay, at length he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a ſpeech of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and would have that interpreted againſt us. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 26. <hi>That a Sermon was uſed to be preached to thoſe that were to be Baptized to renounce the Pomps</hi> &amp;c.

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing his firſt Argument againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe there is no Scripture for it; which is in form as followeth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>If <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> Infant-Baptiſm had been any Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, there would have been ſome Precept, Command or Example in Scripture to warrant the ſame; but inaſmuch as the Scripture is ſo wholly ſilent, there being not one ſyllable to be found in all the New-Teſtament about any ſuch Practice, it may well be concluded to be no Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>THe Argument conſiſting of two Branches, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be anſwered in Parts. Firſt then, to that which hath ever been objected by them, there is no Precept or Command; We anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A thing may be ſaid to be commanded in Scripture two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Expreſly,</hi> or <hi>Liter thy</hi> and <hi>Syllabically,</hi> that is, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem verbis,</hi> in to many plain term, or words. Thus we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57924:76"/>acknowledg Infant-Baptiſm is not commanded; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid, Go, baptize Infants: if it had, there would have been no controverſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A thing may be commanded in Scripture <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,</hi> and by good conſequence; and what is thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is as valid and obliging, as if it were in ſo many letters and ſyllables; and thus we affirm Infant-Baptiſm is commanded. There are in Scripture clear Grounds and Principles. from whence by juſt and warrantable Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it may be deducted, that the Children of Believers have right to Baptiſm; for, if they belong to the Covenant, and are Holy, if they are Members of the viſible Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then they ought to be baptized. So then the Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Practice drawn from a want of expreſs Precept, is built upon a falſe Hypotheſis; That no direct Conſequences from Scripture are mandatory and obliging, contrary to the Judgment of all Orthodox Divines, and the Method of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their Arguings. <hi>Chriſt</hi> proved the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body againſt the <hi>Sadducees</hi> not by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Text, but by Conſequence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. So <hi>Paul</hi> proved the Reſurrection of Chriſt by Conſequence, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33, 34.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There needed no expreſs Command in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Infants ſhould be ſigned and ſealed by Baptiſm, when the Covenant is not aboliſhed that took in the Seed with the Parent: as there needs no expreſs Command for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>Firſt-Day Sabbath</hi> in the New-Teſtament, becauſe the fourth Commandment for ſubſtance is ſtill in force: So there needs no new Command for Baptizing the Infant-ſeed of Believers, becauſe the Command for ſealing ſuch, is for ſubſtance ſtill in force. It is alſo well noted by Mr. <hi>Gerce,</hi> that there is a great difference between an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, and ſome particular Circumſtance, or Subject to which that Ordinance is to be applied. As for the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf the ſetting up of Baptiſm as a Sacrament of the Goſpel-Covenant renewed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this requires expreſs warrant in the Word of God; but when we have ſuch warrant for the Ordinance it ſelf, to whomſoever we find by grounds and principles in Scripture that it doth of right belong, there we may apply it, though we want expreſs Command for it, if we have none againſt it.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57924:76"/>
               <p n="3">3. We farther add what is well argued by ſome Divines: That if the Children of Believers have a right to be Baptized by the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sydenham.</hi>
                  </note> then they have a right to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the word of Command; but the Children of Believers, have a right to be Baptized by the word of Promiſe: therefore they have a right to be Baptized by the word of Command. Now that Children have a right to be Baptized by the word of Promiſe, appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>For the Promiſe is made to you and to your Children,</hi> &amp;c. The exceptions which the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> make againſt this Text ſhall be removed in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Now for the other Branch, there is no Example of Infants being baptized; therefore it is no Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence ſtands upon a lame Leg: for, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn, <hi>a negative Argument in matters of Fact is not valid.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> did many things that were not recorded, and ſo did the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whereof this was one for ought we know, the Baptizing Infants: and it is the more probable upon a twofold account; Firſt, becauſe we find ſuch frequent mention of their <hi>Baptizing whole Families,</hi> as <hi>Stephanus</hi> and his houſhold, <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold, and divers others, as ſoon as we read of the head of the Family to believe, the whole houſhold was baptized. As when <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, he and his whole Family were circumciſed; and ſo when the Head of a Family became a Proſelyte, ordinarily <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His</hi> were Circumciſed. Now in ſo many Families. as were baptized, it cannot rationally be ſuppoſed that there were no Children, and if there were any, they were baptized; for they are a part of the Family or Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. And ſecondly, Becauſe we never read in Scripture of any Children of Believing Parents who were Baptized af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Our Oppoſits will not believe the Apoſtles bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Children, becauſe we can give no particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; but this <hi>Negative Argument</hi> may be thus retorted againſt themſelves. The Children of Believing Parents were baptized in their Infancy, for they cannot find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, any of them that were baptized when they came to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57924:77"/>years of diſcretion, and not before. I urge not this as a concluding, though probable Argument, that in the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> days Children were Baptized; however I am certain, that to ſay Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is no Ordinance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe we have no examples in the Scripture of any that were Baptized, is a pittiful Argument.</p>
               <p>Next, ſaith he, <hi>That there is neither Precept nor Example for any ſuch thing, as Infant-Baptiſm in the Scripture, we have the ingenuous Confeſſion of the parties themſelves. The</hi> Magdeburgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>do ſay, That concerning the Baptiſing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>we have ſufficient proof; but as to the Baptizing of Infants, they can meet with no Example in the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very good <hi>Sr.</hi> now you have learnt to ſet down things right, but why did you ſay in the 56 page of your Treatiſe referring to the ſame place <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 496. That the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> as to the Subjects of Baptiſm tell us, that in this Age they only Baptized the Adult; was that <hi>lapſus calami</hi> or <hi>mentis?</hi> And do you not know that in the ſame place they tell us, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular inſtances cannot be found, (as all the <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> confeſs); yet 'tis evident from the Writings of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants from Baptiſm, and then bring Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the lawfulneſs of it, as before?</p>
               <p>For that of <hi>Luther</hi> in his Epiſtle of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> I have not the Book by me to Examine it, yet I am ſure by what the Author cites it hurts us not. <hi>The Scriptures</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do no where clearly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57924:77"/>and plainly with theſe, or the like words ſay, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize your Children for they believe: and we muſt needs yield to thoſe that drive us to the Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſtill no more than what we all ſay: we all acknowledg it is no-where written, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do believe (as <hi>Lutherans</hi> hold they do); and again we ſay as <hi>Luther</hi> did, it is no-where written clearly and plainly, with theſe words, <hi>Baptize your Children for they Believe.</hi> Nor have <hi>Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> any command in ſo many words, Go and Baptize actual and viſible Believers. If they ſay ſuch were Baptized, we may reply with Mr. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbam,</hi> that is not to the purpoſe: for it is a verbal command, which they require to give warrant to an Ordinance, and for ought we can learn from <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Commiſſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. Whoſoever are taught (be the parties never ſo wicked) they muſt be Baptized (if they will) for there is no mention made of their entertainment of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Next he Fathers that upon <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> which was never ſpoken by him in his Comment upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Namely, <hi>That Baptizing of infants was not in uſe in St.</hi> Paul's <hi>time.</hi> There is no ſuch word, I aſſure thee, Reader, there.</p>
               <p>Again, in his <hi>4th</hi> Book <hi>de Ratione Concionandi,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That they are not to be condemned that doubt whether Childrens Baptiſm were Ordained by the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why, <hi>Sir,</hi> did you not ſpeak out all? You know <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his words are theſe: <hi>Probabile eſt tingere Infantes inſtitutum fuiſſe ab Apoſtolis, non damnaretur tamen qui de hoc dubitaret.</hi> It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the Baptiſm of Infants was inſtituted by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57924:78"/>Apoſtles, nevertheleſs if one doubt thereof he ſhould not be condemned. In this <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaks like an honeſt, moderat-Spirited man, that would not have weak Chriſtians Anathematized (as the Papiſts uſe to do) for their diſſent in Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Diſputable points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>4th</hi> Book <hi>of Inſtitutes, Chap.</hi> 16. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>that it is no-where expreſly mentioned by the Evangeliſts, that any one Child was by the Apoſtles Baptized:</hi> to the ſame purpoſe are <hi>Staphilus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon, Zwinglius</hi> quoted; to which I only ſay, That whereas they all tell us, there is no expreſs Command or expreſs Example, an Implicite one is ſufficient; ſo that in this long train of Authors which our <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> quotes, he doth but <hi>magno conatu nugas agere,</hi> take a great deal of pains in trifling. But that which he cites from Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> ſeems to have more weight, who in his Treatiſe about Baptiſm, Part 29. <hi>Confeſſeth himſelf to be unconvinced by demonſtration of Scripture for it.</hi> This is taken from Mr. <hi>Tombe's Examen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tombes <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> p. 2.</note> pag. 2. To which I anſwer, one man may be fully convinced by Scripture-demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, when another is not: but 'tis fit the Reader ſhould know all that Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> ſaith there upon the point; for it is unhandſome to bring in ſcraps out of Authors. He tells us, he no leſs doubts of the warrantableneſs of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than he doth of the Creed, ſaying that ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry learned men have undertaken to ſtop their Schiſmatical mouths that oppoſe it, and to anſwer their peeviſh Arguments; and though he ſaith his ſcope tends another way, yet gives his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57924:78"/>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Circumciſion was applyed to the Infants on the <hi>8th</hi> day in the Old-Teſtament,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no word in the New-Teſtament to infringe the liberty of the Church in it: nor ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſon why we ſhould bereave her of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sundry Scriptures afford friendly proofs by Conſequence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The holineſs of the Child (External and Viſible) is from their Parents, therefore the ſeed being holy, and belonging to the Govenant, the Lord graciouſly admits them to the Seal of it by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Farther he brings a paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Baxters plain Scripture-proof for Infants Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Baptiſm,</hi> Where he confeſſeth, pag. 3. <hi>That Infant-Baptiſm is not plainly determined in Scripture.</hi>

               <p>But (ſaith he) many others as difficult, which then were no Controverſies, have no ſuch deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: and yet [mark it] the Scripture is ſufficient to direct for the determination of theſe too; if we have wiſdom to diſcern the Scope of the Spirit, to apply general rules to particular caſes: Such is the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the <hi>9th</hi> page we have this, The grounds (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) upon which Infants are Baptized <hi>are very eaſy, and plain,</hi> though to many it be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

               <argument>
                  <p>The Hiſtorical Account which the <hi>Author</hi> gives of Iafant-Brptiſm in its Riſe and Eſtabliſhment, Examined and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>In this Chapter he preſents us with the Hiſtory of Infant-Baptiſm, and tells ſtrange news, if you will credit him of its Original ſince the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> days. Thus he begins:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the learned Authorities before given, we have gained thus much; that as there was no Precept in Scripture, for the Baptizing of Infants, ſo neither was there the leaſt Practice to be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>days, as was ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly before Confeſſed by the</hi> Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes, Luther, Calvin, Eraſmus, Rogers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. BUt we have made it appear, Sr. that you rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon your gains too faſt, and have much erred in caſting up the Sum, as the Reader may find in the preceding Chapter. I queſtion not if he be impartial he will conclude you have not gained a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57924:80"/>farthing, but are rather a loſer hitherto. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all thoſe Learned Authorities before given, there is no paſſage (although never ſo much ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) that ſaith any more than this: There is no <hi>Expreſs</hi> precept in Scripture for the Baptizing of Infants, and this every Child knows, but in ſaying there is no <hi>Expreſs</hi> one, they intimate thereby, there is an <hi>Implicite</hi> one. I love not to repeat, the <hi>Reader</hi> may, if he pleaſe, reflect upon what they ſay. And in aſmuch as the point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to matter of Fact, notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the adverſe party, unleſs they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one <hi>Expreſs</hi> place of Scripture, where it is ſaid, No Infant was Baptized, or ſome <hi>Expreſs</hi> Command not to Baptize them, their calling for an Expreſs Command, concludes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Practice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover we affirm againſt their Practice, that there is no <hi>Expreſs</hi> Command in all the Book of God, to plunge perſons Head and Ears under water: nor can they by any convincing Circumſtance about the manner of Baptizing, make it appear (though thouſands were Baptized in a day) that any one was ſo ſeverely dealt with in the primitive times: we ſhall ſhew, when we come to it, that the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] among <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Writers doth promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſignify to dip into, or waſh with Water by pouring on of it; and in the Scripture it is more frequently taken for Waſhing, than dipping.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have no <hi>Expreſs</hi> Command or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to Baptize, or plunge themſelves as they do with their Cloaths on; which is rather a Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Garments, than Bodies. Since they are ſo
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57924:81"/>much for Expreſs Command and Example, let them firſt juſtify their own Practice by it, before they condemn us for want of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He tells us, <hi>That the approved Practice and known cuſtom of the Primitive Church was to Baptize the Adult, as all Ages acknowledg, and only they, at leaſt for the firſt, as is ſo fully atteſted by</hi> Euſobius, Beatus Rhenanus, Lud. Vives, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger, Haimo, <hi>the</hi> Neocaeſarian <hi>Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look back <hi>Reader</hi> to that ſaithful Account I have given from the <hi>Magdeburgenſian Century</hi>-Writers, and thou ſhalt be able to judg of the truth of what he ſpeaks. I am neceſſitated to touch upon it again, what <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Origens</hi> being a Teacher before Baptiſm, refers to the <hi>Pagans;</hi> what that Old <hi>Popiſh</hi> St. <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> ſaith of the Ancient cuſtom which was to Baptize thoſe that were come to full growth, with the Bath of Regeneration, if it relates to <hi>Heathens</hi> it is no more to purpoſe than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer out of <hi>Euſebius;</hi> but if we are to underſtand him ſo, as if no Children were anciently admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Baptiſm, no, not thoſe of Believers, then we plead an older cuſtom, even as old as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that Children were Baptized in the Church: and as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> hath it in his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> The Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Infant Baptiſm hath been perpetually obſerved in the Chriſtian Church, for there is no ancient Writer that doth not acknowledg its Original, even from the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> which

And laſtly for the <hi>Neocaeſarian Council,</hi> that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is of a very ridiculous nature, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the queſtion; for the matter under debate in that Council, was about a Woman that was pregnant, who being an Infidel came to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the <hi>Canon</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a one, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57924:82"/>not of a Woman that was within the Church, &amp; of a Child born of a believing Parent, as is fully ſhewn before in <hi>Cent.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Whereas, he ſaith, <hi>not only the Children of,</hi> Pagans <hi>were to be Inſtructed, and taught in the Faith, in order to Baptiſm; but the Children of</hi> Chriſtians <hi>alſo: as thoſe famous inſtances given from the 4th Century.</hi> We have ſhewn in our diſcourſe upon that Century, the corrupt and ſilly grounds upon which they deferred Baptiſm till they were grown up, in thoſe days, and ſome of the inſtances there given had Parents that were Heathens, when they were born, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till they were come to Maturity, and that was the reaſon they were Baptized, though 'tis true, their Parents were at laſt converted to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He farther ſaith, <hi>that as there was no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Authority for it, ſo no Human Authority, till above</hi> 400 <hi>years after Chriſt; though to juſtify that injunction, Apoſtolical-Tradition, to ſupply the want of Scripture-Inſtitution, was pretended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may almoſt ſay truly of this <hi>Quot dicta, tot maledicta;</hi> ſo many words, ſo many foul reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Calumniare fortiter &amp; aliquid adhaerebit,</hi> ſaid <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and our <hi>Author</hi> follows the Rule exactly, he thinks he can never throw dirt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon Infant-Baptiſm, hoping ſome will at laſt ſtick. I ſhall Reply to this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſay there is no Scripture-Authority for Infant-Baptiſm, and that <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Tradition was on purpoſe brought in to ſupply the want of it, are preſumptuous, weak, and falſe dictates: Since the ſame Men, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Fathers,</hi> that call
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57924:82"/>it an <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Tradition, do upon the matter all of them, plead for it upon <hi>Scripture</hi>-grounds as <hi>Cyprian, Nazianzen, Chryſoſtom, Ambroſ, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phartius,</hi> who argue for Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe it came in the room of Circumciſion, and from the right the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> had to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and of latter days <hi>Proteſtants</hi> own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for truth that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Apoſtolical</hi>-Tradition,<note place="margin">Proinde neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio veniendum erat ad argumenta ex Scripturis: quae ſi rem non evincant, fruſtrà traditionem ad vocabimus <hi>Riv.</hi> Animad. in annot-<hi>Grotii</hi> in Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum. <hi>Art. 9. p. 71.</hi>

               <p>And Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe in his Inſtructions againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts.

For I well know that as the cuſtom of men, doth not give Authority to the Sacrament, ſo the uſe of the Sacrament cannot be ſaid to be right, becauſe regulated by Cuſtom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What though there was no Human-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for it till above 400 years after Chriſt, is this any Argument againſt it? The Author bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows this from Dr. <hi>Taylors Lib.</hi> of <hi>Proph.</hi> p. 237. for he learns how to ſpeak from him: the <hi>Drs.</hi> Words are — as there was no Command
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57924:83"/>in Scripture to oblige Children to the ſuſception of it; ſo the neceſſity of <hi>Paedobaptiſm</hi> was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Church, till the <hi>Canon</hi> that was made in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council. This <hi>Milevitan African Council</hi> was <hi>Ann. Ch.</hi> 418. and belike the reaſon why it was not eſtabliſhed ſooner by Councils under an <hi>Anathema,</hi> was becauſe it was rarely, if at all queſtioned or oppoſed till then, by any perſon of note, as to its lawfulneſs. Hear what Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays in anſwer to Dr <hi>Taylor,</hi> about this matter: It being granted by the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter,</hi> ſaith he, that <hi>Paedobaptiſm</hi> was by <hi>Canon</hi> Eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Milevitan African Council, Ann. Ch.</hi> 418. yet, as long as it is alſo confeſſed, that it was practiſed in <hi>Africa</hi> before, there will be little concluded againſt us. For what ſtood by <hi>Apoſtolical Practice</hi> and known <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be preſcribed by <hi>Canon,</hi> as that which prevails by force of a <hi>greater,</hi> need not be aſſiſted by a <hi>weaker Authority.</hi> And indeed while the foot-ſteps of ſo <hi>Authentique</hi> a <hi>Tradition</hi> were ſo lively and no <hi>Adverſary,</hi> or <hi>Diſputer</hi> ſtarted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no <hi>queſtion</hi> or <hi>oppoſition</hi> yet made againſt a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage,</hi> 'twere ridiculous for <hi>Councils</hi> to convene, and fortify it by <hi>Canons:</hi> and ſo the only thing reaſonably deducible from the lateneſs of thoſe <hi>Canons,</hi> is, that all that while it was <hi>univerſally</hi> received without <hi>Oppoſition:</hi> I mean not, ſaith the <hi>Dr,</hi> that no <hi>Infant,</hi> or any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was <hi>unbaptized</hi> through the ſpace of thoſe firſt (4) <hi>Centuries,</hi> but that the <hi>extending</hi> of the <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>Infants,</hi> was not Oppoſed in the Church till about <hi>Pelagius's</hi> days, whoſe opinion of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Sin (utterly denying the <hi>guilt</hi> of it on

                        </expan> ad nauſeam,</hi> I ſhall paſs a few <hi>Remarks</hi> thereupon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The multitude of Authors quoted, argues great oſtentation of much Reading, though much of it is prepared to his hand, and for certain, the moſt is rather <hi>ad Pompam</hi> than <hi>ad Pugnum,</hi> rather for <hi>ſhew</hi> than <hi>ſervice.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Yet hath he manifeſted ſome Artifice, and cunning;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In raking out of the Dung-hil, all the filthy Rites uſed by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſm, as <hi>Exorciſm, Chriſm, Salt, Albes,</hi> or <hi>White-Garments, Milk, Honey &amp;c.</hi> And his deſign herein is to dazle the eyes of the weaker ſort, and to make them believe even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm it ſelf is alſo a corrupt Innovation. But this will not take with the judicious who are able to diſtinguiſh between the accidental Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an Ordinance and the Ordinance it ſelf. We know <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath defiled moſt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt and annexed thereto many Superſtitious Ceremonies: as in the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Communion, Adoration of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is enjoyned, and yet theſe do not diſparage the Ordinance it ſelf, in the Inſtitution and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, but only defile the Communicants that ſo ſuperſtitiouſly uſe that Sacred Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have affixt theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Rites, not only to the Baptiſm of Infants, but of thoſe alſo who are grown up: and ſo the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57924:85"/>force of arguing from them, if Infant-Baptiſm were removed, wil ly againſt Baptiſm it ſelf. We ought not therefore to impute theſe corruptions to God's Ordinance of Baptizing Infants, and on that account deride and caſhier it, but rather as the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> do <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 111. to the Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> of vind.

Indeed, ſaith Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> the <hi>Martyr.</hi> (to his fellow-ſufferer that ſcrupled Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and afterward was ſatisfied by the ſtrength of his Arguments) if you look upon the Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Synagogue only which have corrupted God's Word by falſe interpretation, and hath pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true uſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Sacraments, you may ſeem to have good handfaſt of your opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Baptiſm of Infants; but for as much as it is of more Antiquity, and hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God's Word, and from the uſe of the Primitive Church, it muſt not in reſpect of the abuſe in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church be neglected, or thought inexpedient. Nor hath the Baptiſm of <hi>Adult</hi> Perſons in former times been free from many corrupt, and ridiculous Human inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> out of <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſhews at large.

                  <p n="4">4. There are ſome errors or falſities in it. As <hi>Tertullian's</hi> ſtanding up againſt. Infant-Baptiſm in the <hi>3d Century;</hi> when he ſtood up no more againſt it, than he did againſt the Baptizing of Young-men that were unmarried, and Young-Widows alſo, whoſe Baptiſm he would have delayed. 'Tis certain he argues for the delay of Baptiſm in ſome caſes (<hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipue circa paroulos,</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Error reſpecting this <hi>Century,</hi> is, <hi>That the</hi> Magdeburgenſes <hi>tell us, they altered the form of Baptiſm, from dipping to ſprinkling:</hi> referring us to Cent. 3. pag. 129. where they ſpeak no ſuch thing nor any-where elſe in the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Eſcape, is, <hi>That Infant-Baptiſm was not in uſe in the greateſt part of the 4th Century ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek Church.</hi> Now this is very falſe, nor will that help him which he adds afterward, Scil. <hi>It is true</hi> (ſaith he) towards the latter end of this <hi>Century,</hi> it is ſaid, that in ſome parts of <hi>Africa</hi> they did Baptize Children as <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg</hi> Cent. 4. p. 415. but they ſay no ſuch thing; it is only the Authors own ſaying: and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57924:86"/>really it troubles me to ſee ſo much prevarication every-where. Take Reader the true account of what the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> ſay <hi>de Ritibus circa Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum,</hi> about Baptiſmal Rites. They are large in this Chapter, and begin it thus, That the power of Baptizing was in this Age in the Prieſts, and principally in the Biſhops, and then in Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons, and then a few lines after they tell us, <hi>Baptizabantur autem publice in templis cujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

Nor hath this Chapter any ſuch paſſage at the beginning, middle, or latter end; that in ſome parts of <hi>Africa</hi> they did Baptize Children.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I will not ſay, there is a Tincture of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, but am ſure of ſomething like it, in that ſaying of the Authors <hi>pag.</hi> 128. of his Treatiſe <hi>viz. In this [6th] Century</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we meet with a dreadful piece of Infant-Baptiſm viz.</hi> The Heads of 6000 Infants that had been murdered &amp; buried in a Warren near a Monaſtery, as teſtified by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ldricus</hi> to <hi>P. Nicolas, Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 338. But the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> are not ſo bold as the Author, to call ſuch horrid murder Infant-Baptiſm. A tender conſcience me thinks ſhould be afraid thus to play with Holy things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This Hiſtory of his affords ſome contradiction to himſelf, I mean to what he hath before written: for in the firſt part of his Book <hi>Cap,</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. he quotes <hi>Bede</hi> for a Teſtimony, that the Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Believers is the only true Baptiſm — <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Men were firſt to be inſtructed unto the Knowledg of the Truth, then to be Baptized, as Chriſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57924:87"/>hath taught &amp;c. Cent.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 220. Whereas in this his Second part of the Treatiſe, which is for diſproving Infant-Baptiſm, pag. 130. <hi>Bede alſo concludes for the Baptizing of Infants,</hi> Cent. 8. p. 218.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We obſerve too great a boldneſs in thoſe ſcandalous Reflections which he caſts upon the Churches of the Reformed Religion, ſparing none, neither <hi>Lutherans,</hi> nor <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> nor: <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> But me thinks 'tis a piece of great indiſcretion to fly out ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for if ſhe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to give the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> indifferent good quarter although they do not conform to her, why ſhould any of them vilify her in this manner? As for the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> the Author may more ſecurely mock at it, and there is no danger in having a fling at the Directory, or at the old Parliament's Ordinance of May 2d. 1648. which made it impriſonment to affirm Infant-Baptiſm is unlawful.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>1.</hi> The firſt and Principal ground <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that hath been aſſerted for this Practice is Eccleſiaſtical and Apoſtolical Tradition.</p>
               <p>THis is a falſe ſuggeſtion, and exceeds all modeſty: for although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſcribes too much to Tradition, as in many other things; yet the Ancient Fathers, as <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Nazianzen, Chryſoſtom,</hi> with divers others, as is before ſhewn, plead Baptiſm to come in the room of Circumciſion, and that Infants have right thereto, from the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right to Circumciſion, whereby 'tis evident that Tradition hath not been primarily aſſerted to be the ground of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He farther ſaith, <hi>The Proteſtants ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, have choſe to fly to ſome conſequential Arguments deducted, as they ſuppoſe, from the Scriptures, to prove the ſame: both which in this Chapter are brought forth, and duely weighed in the Ballance of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:57924:88"/>
               <p>We doubt not in the Proceſs of the diſcourſe to ſhew, that after we have weighed what she ſaith, we ſhall find it too light, and to be but chaff in ſtead of Truth. The <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he ſaith, have choſe to fly to conſequential Arguments, deduced as they ſuppoſe from Scripture. But the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> are of another mind, and ſuppoſe themſelves to be Men of deeper Reaſon, and more piercing inſpection into the ſence of the Scriptures, than all the Godly and Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſince the Reformation. They ſee the miſtaken conceits they have of Scripture, and how ungroundedly they draw their conſequences from thence. An Argument indeed it is of much modeſty, for the Author to ſpeak at this rate: I would ask any of theſe Men, who are ſo highly conceited of their Scripture-Knowledg, why <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſts,</hi> that are humble, ſearching, praying Chriſtians, may not underſtand ſo much of God's mind in Scripture as they? <hi>Doth the Word of God come out from them?</hi> or <hi>doth it come to them only?</hi>

                     <hi>John</hi> 17.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37.</note> or have they only the Spirit of Illumination? or are they the only Maſters of right Reaſons? Or dare they ſay 'tis unlawful to make uſe of Conſequences? Or may not we be permitted to uſe them for Infant-Baptiſm aſwel as they againſt it? Do not they argue from <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18, 19. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. None ought to be Baptized but ſuch who are firſt taught, and conſequently that no Children ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, becauſe they be not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of teaching.<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Tombes.</hi>
                  </note> Is not this. their conſtant way of Arguing?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57924:88"/>Now how unreaſonable is it for men to practiſe that themſelves, which they will not allow of in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

If I prove that all Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt be admitted by Baptiſm, and then prove that Infants of Believers are Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is not this aſmuch as to prove that they muſt be Baptized? I ſuppoſe no man of ſound judgment will deny that the ſence, or meaning of Scripture, is Scripture as well as the Letters, and Syllables in the Bible: For the ſence, and meaning of the Letter of the Word muſt be drawn out by rational Conſequence, as the concluſion from a Propoſition by a fit <hi>medium;</hi> and if this were not ſo, the ſearching and ſtudying of the Scriptures were a needleſs undertaking, and ſo would all Preaching and Expounding be. It is a good obſervation of Dr. <hi>Sclater</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi>

To which we anſwer, we have it not in Expreſs terms, but by juſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

You are wont to boaſt, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> of the Word of God, and to reduce all your Opinions to this one head, but in the Caſe of Juſtification by Faith only, that help fails you; for you were never able to ſhew in the Scripture that particle [only]. To this we Reply, that if we have it by Conſequence from Scripture, and if we have it in the Equivalency, we have it in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Tradition hath been the firſt and principal ground of Infant-Baptiſm, he would prove from</hi> Auſtin, <hi>and</hi> Chryſoſtom's <hi>ſayings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how, and in what ſenſe do they call it a Tradition of the Church? why certainly not as if the Church had been the <hi>Author,</hi> but the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57924:89"/>of it as before, as continued therein all along down from the Apoſtles.

               <p>And becauſe the way of ſatisfying this enquiry, is but the ſaying over again all that hath been formerly ſaid on this ſubject, this whole Diſcourſe having laid the weight of all upon this one <hi>Baſis,</hi> the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> it will be unreaſonable to do this any farther, ſave only upon a brief <hi>Recapitulation,</hi> to refer it to the judgment of any ſober <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> Whether firſt, by <hi>Chriſts</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>Baptizing of Proſelytes,</hi>

               <p>Concerning the two firſt of theſe we look u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them as broken Reeds and we lean not on them at all: and to produce an Argument for the Apoſtolicalneſs of <hi>Paedobaptiſm</hi> from theſe is (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſpeaks of ſome which he likes not) to be look upon of the number of the <hi>Blind</hi> and the <hi>Lame,</hi> that are of more uſe to betray and loſe, than defend and ſecure that <hi>Fort</hi> in which they are placed.

               <p>This is ſomething more than the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> ſpeak of him, and they have only <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> word for what they ſay; who was his mortal enemy, and they report none of the beſt neither concerning <hi>Jerom,</hi> as they have it from the Pen of <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> No doubt <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was no better than he ſhould be; but for certain the <hi>Author</hi> is too partial for an Hiſtorian, laying all the blame upon <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> when the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> do condemn them both for their Enmity and unchriſtian-like carriage to each other, and in ſome things do vindicate <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and blame <hi>Jerom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore take the freedom partly for diverſion, and to rectify the Story, to give a brief account of the matter. In the firſt place the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> do inform us, That there was at firſt a more than ordinary friendſhip, and familiarity between theſe two, how they were as Brethren and Companions in Study; but at length there happened to be <hi>vehemens diſſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> a great breach between them, in ſo much that they became great enemies. But what was the cauſe hereof cannot be found in any of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> Writings: after this they became friends again, at leaſt in appearance.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57924:97"/>
               <p>But the wound was not thorowly healed, but only skinned over, for a while after there aroſe a new quarrel, and they were ſet at a farther diſtance than ever; they fall to calumniating and writing bitter invectives againſt each other, and they are both accuſed by the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi> for the virulency of their Pens.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Ruffinus</hi> chargeth <hi>Jerom</hi> to be infected with <hi>Origen</hi>'s Hereſies, and put him to the trouble of an Apology; and beſides he accuſeth him that he had not rightly tranſlated the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, inſtancing in ſeveral places. Then <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> recriminats and accuſeth him for tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Origen's</hi> Works with his <hi>Naevi</hi> or Errors, to the blemiſh of <hi>Origen,</hi> and danger of infecting the World thereby. And here let me tell you the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> interpoſe and ſpeak their ſence of the matter, that though <hi>Jerom</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo highly, yet it was <hi>nimis languida ut videtur ratione,</hi> without ſufficient ground for ought that they could find: For ſay they, <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,</hi> neither defended nor aſſerted <hi>Origen's</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, nor was the firſt that tranſlated his Works; nor did he undertake it <hi>arbitrio ſuo</hi> by his own inclination, but <hi>ad Fratrum preces</hi> at the deſire of his Brethren, as he fully ſhews in the Apology which he made to <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> for his Faith, a confeſſion whereof they alſo ſet down, which is very Orthodox. <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 1202, 1203.</p>

               <p>I ſhall only add thoſe remarkable Words of Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> the Martyr, in his Letter to his fellow-ſufferer that ſcrupled Infant-Baptiſm; which with the Scripture-Arguments he uſed, proved ſo effectual, that (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of <hi>Martyrs</hi> tells us) the diſſatisfied Perſon came thereby to be eſtabliſhed in the doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, and dyed in the Belief of its war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs.

               <p n="1">1. Had I been to chooſe my own Weapons, I would have let alone ſome of thoſe the Author pitcht upon.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:57924:102"/>
               <p>Secondly, Neither would I have ordered the the Proofs from ſome of the Texts in ſo flight a manner, as he doth; for if a Weapon be ſharp and keen, yet if an Enemy have the handling of it how can we expect, unleſs he be the more ingenious, but that he will blunt the edg of it. And that Adverſary ſhews but ſorry valour, which knocks in the head ſome Arguments of ſtraw, which he hath framed to ſhew his skill on.</p>
               <p>In my Opinion it had been more ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Author,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) To have choſen for usonly the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places that carry the cleareſt evidence, and to have pretermitted the reſt: For if the chiefeſt places will hold good, the reſt which are dark and diſputable whether they belong to the point, may well be let alone; and if the chiefeſt will not carry it; much leſs will the other: yet this is certain that if the ſtrength of every one of thoſe Texts which he produceth for us, were eluded, ſave one, yet that one would carry it; for though two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be needful for men, yet one ſingle one is as valid for God, as if there were many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57924:102"/>
               <p n="2">2. To have pitcht only upon thoſe Texts, wherein all Proteſtants both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> Paedobaptiſts) concurr in, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the point; whereas he knows it is controverted among them, whether ſome of the Scriptures produced have any thing to do with <hi>Infant-Baptiſme,</hi> as both the ſecond and third Texts inſtanced in: Nay the third which contains Chriſts Commiſſion for Baptiſm, is that which the Author and his party judge to be the main ground for Baptizing Believers, and excluding Infants. And we know that this is their main Argument, that Infants are not to be baptized, becauſe they cannot believe, and truly we were very ſparing of places to prove childrens Baptiſm, if we ſhould pitch upon <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. for it. And here I profeſs my ſelf to be of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> mind, <hi>Poſ.</hi> 7. <hi>pag,</hi> 7. <hi>of his plain proof</hi> — I cannot deny, ſaith he, but that ſome Divines have brought ſome miſ-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Scriptures for Infant-Baptiſm: Now it is eaſie to write againſt theſe and ſeem to triumph, and yet the cauſe be no way ſhaken: ſome ſilly people think, when they hear an impertinent Text put by, that all is done: when it may be all the moſt plain Scriptures and beſt arguments have never been anſwered with ſenſe or reaſon. Having ſaid thus much, I come now to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is againſt that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this our Author Objects — <hi>May we not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57924:103"/>ſay, How doth Baptiſm come to be concerned in this Text,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, Firſt, I conceive none did ever bring this place as of it ſelf, a full and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect proof for Infants-Baptiſm. But ſecondly it doth prove two points, which lay a good ground work for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Kingdom of God is made up as well of <hi>Infants</hi> as of <hi>grown</hi> perſons: if any by Kingdom of Heaven, will needs underſtand it of the Kingdom of Glory; let him conſider that none are of that Kingdom, who were not firſt of the Church, firſt of the Kingdom of grace here, and ſo it comes all to one, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, of which you pleaſe. The Kingdom of God is made up as well of Infants as Adult perſons:<note place="margin">
                     <p>Quùm jubet Infantes ad ſe accedere, nihil cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riùs quàm veram In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantiam notari.</p>
                     <p>Inſtit. Chriſt. Relig. Calv. compend. per <hi>Launeum,</hi> cap. <hi>17.</hi> p. <hi>325.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> for Chriſt ſaith, it is of <hi>ſuch (i.e.)</hi> Children: not of grown men reſembling Children. For firſt, That had been no good reaſon why ſuch ſhould come to him and be bleſſed of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That had been no reaſon why Chriſt ſhould manifeſt ſo great diſpleaſure againſt his Diſciples, for going about to hinder them. The word is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] rendred in the New Tranſlation, much diſpleaſed; The vulgar hath it <hi>indignè tulit. he took it ill at their hands, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignatus eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza, be lookt upon it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second, The ſecond point which it proves,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57924:103"/>which is alſo a good ground-work; for the ſame, is, That Infancy is no bar or excluſion of any from coming to Chriſt, and receiving a Bleſſing. Infants are capable of benefit by Chriſt, although they do not actually believe; though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay hold on Chriſt, yet Chriſt can lay hold on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Baptiſm is not concerned in the Text, except it can be made out that, that <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> was <hi>Baptizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is certain that <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is not <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> but tis ſomething more, and Chriſt in bleſſing them vouchſafed that to them, which uſually was an Ordinance adminiſtred after Baptiſm, and which is of a higher nature,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17, 18, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.6.</note> and ſo we may argue from this to Baptiſm <hi>Incluſively,</hi> or <hi>a majori,</hi> from the greater.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though <hi>Bleſſing</hi> be not Baptiſm, yet in as much as they were of the Kingdom of Heaven whom he bleſt, it follows they were qualified Subjects for Baptiſm, for grant to Infants a Church relation, and their Baptiſm will follow upon it; if one ſtands good the other will, and this is all we plead for, from the Text.</p>
               <p>For that which follows out of Dr. <hi>Taylor; Chriſt Bleſſed Children, and ſo diſmiſſed them, therefore Infants aré not to be Baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a very idle one. For, Firſt, from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Omiſſion to conclude an univerſal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs, is moſt unreaſonable, as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> ſpeaks. It is as if one ſhould thus argue, [Chriſt when he Preached in the Mount, did
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57924:104"/>not then pray, but only preach, therefore 'tis not lawful to pray. Secondly Chriſt did not that we know baptize any, <hi>John</hi> 4.2. And if an Argument drawn from his Example Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, be preſſing, it would conclude as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Baptizing thoſe of riper years, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 3. Since <hi>Chriſt</hi> did that for them which did tranſcend Baptiſm, we may rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; that certainly, if he had Baptized any he would thoſe children, ſince he ſhews more reſpect to them then any grown perſons.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sydenbam</hi> in his Chriſtian and ſober Exercitation.</note> Fourthly, <hi>Chriſts</hi> Bleſſing them holds forth as much as if he had baptized them: for in that outward rite the Holy Ghoſt was convey'd, and by laying on of hands, others received it, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17, 18, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.6. And why not in this Act of Chriſt, upon the Infants (as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> argues) And if this Act of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were not a complement only, but an outward ſign of the receiving the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Who ſhould hinder Water that Infants ſhould not be Baptized, ſeeing they have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? Act.</hi> 10.47. And the ſame Author farther adds— What can be more then for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to take up Infants in his Arms, lay his hands on them, as an outward ſign to conſecrate them to himſelf, and to ſhew their capacity of receiving the Holy Ghoſt, and then to bleſs them? And yet we muſt with ſcorn deny them a little water, and think it too much to have them named among the loweſt ſort of viſible Saints, and when <hi>Chriſt</hi> owns
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57924:104"/>them publickly, and ſaith, that of <hi>ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> But I ſhall rather believe <hi>Chriſts</hi> Teſtimony, then any mans forward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. And to what intent ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> do all this, but to confirm their old ſtate in the Church, and not to caſt them out of it, and from the participation of all outward ſignes of falvation? Let mens conſciences, not gulph'd in prejudice, judge: This Text, if there were no more, will fly, (ſaith he) in the conſciences one day of the moſt confident contemners of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and their Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>A Second Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced and excepted againſt is, that <hi>John</hi> 3.5.<note place="margin">Second Scripture. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced and excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Except a man be born of Water, and the Spirit, he can in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of God. From whence</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>'tis concluded, That there is no other way to Regenerate and ſave Infants, and add them to the Church, but by Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who are they that conclude thus from that Text? The Papiſts, as himſelf confeſſeth: And what I pray is that to us? who diſclaim ſuch inferences, as he alſo acknowledgeth we do, and for very good reaſons, and he might have done well to have ſet them down for the benefit of his Reader, ſome of them I ſhall name as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks in his Inſtitutions,<note place="margin">Inſtit. Chriſt. Relig. <hi>Calv.</hi> Compend. p. <hi>322.</hi> per <hi>Launeum</hi> edit. 2d.</note> 
                  <hi>Salus conſiſtit in promiſſione, Salvation depends upon Gods Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.7. which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57924:105"/>he cites, adding in the ſame place, Infants may be capable of Salvation without <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who dyed without <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> Though there be an <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are ſaved, they muſt be ſaved by the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> yet there is not an abſolute neceſſity of the Seal. Before the law the Covenant was made, for our comfort, in reſpect of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3.15. yet there was no ſeal to it for 2000. years, nor was there ſuch <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity afterward in the days of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, for thoſe that dyed before the eighth day. The neceſſity of Salvation by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was <hi>abſolute,</hi> but the neceſſity of the ſeal only <hi>Conditional,</hi> ſo far forth as it may be had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Baptiſm be of abſolute neceſſity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that regeneration is affixt to it, and none can be ſaved without it, then it is in mans power to ſave, and to deſtroy, if they will bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize their children they may ſave them, if they neglect it, damn them, which is a horrible ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to conceive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Now to the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelf, we ſhall next enquire what it affords, with great reſpect to the Learned, which may judge otherwiſe of it.</p>
               <p>Either this Scripture is to be underſtood of Baptiſm or not? if of Baptiſm, then either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally belonging to all men,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sclater</hi> on the <hi>4.</hi> Rom. ver. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> or limitedly to Infants only: If of Infants only, then ſaith Dr. <hi>Solater,</hi> 1.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57924:105"/>What meant <hi>Chriſt</hi> to propound it to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> an old man? Was it his purpoſe to teach him; that in as much as he was not Baptized in his infancy, he could not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God? then ſure, I ſhall not wonder, if <hi>Nicodemus</hi> conceited a neceſſity, for an old man deſiring to come to Heaven, to return back into his Mothers Womb, and be born again. 2. Will they ſay, it muſt have this gloſs by limitation; if a man want Baptiſm by contempt and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? why then ſhould it ſtand in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infants in their own perſons not capable of contemning, and whoſe Parents deſire it, but are prevented by neceſſity? Alas! poor infants, that you, free from contempt in your ſelves, and your Parents alſo, muſt yet away to Hell for bare want of Baptiſm; and yet grown perſons [as Papiſts themſelves acknowledge] in the ſame want, have acceſs to Heaven, ſo they be free from contempt: Can we imagine bare want to be more prejudicial to Infants, then to grown men.</p>
               <p>But what <hi>Reader,</hi> if it appear that the place cannot be underſtood of Baptiſm at all? I muſt leave it to thee to judge of what is offered, to ſhew, that 'tis only Regeneration and not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that is concerned in the Text, for <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> here by an <hi>Exegeſis</hi> are one, or if you will according to the judgement of Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> by Water is meant the effect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Nor is this the ſingle judgment of Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> but very many others, who in their time were the <hi>Magna Eccleſiae lumina,</hi> who ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, amongſt whom are <hi>Calvin, Beza, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57924:106"/>Calvin</hi> indeed acknowledgeth the ancient Expoſitors followed <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that the <hi>Text</hi> was to be underſtood of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> yet profeſſeth himſelf of another mind. <hi>Beza</hi> in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the place declares himſelf to the ſame purpoſe, that he underſtood by <hi>Water</hi> in that place is meant rather the effect of the ſpirit then the Sacrament of Baptiſm — <hi>ſin verò malimus Chriſtum cum Phariſaeo diſſerentem Aquae nomine, ad externas ablutiones alluſiſſe, &amp;c. I rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> Chriſt <hi>reaſoning with this Phariſee under the name of Water, doth allude to thoſe external wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, which were uſeleſs without the cleanſing of the Spirit. Et Spiritus nomen ſit exegeſis</hi> [that is, a figure which ſignifies a dark ſpeech made clear by another word, which here is the <hi>Spirit</hi>] <hi>nominis aquae, ſicut alibi ſpiritus &amp; ignis in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo conjunguntur, By the name of Water we are to underſtand by an</hi> Exegeſis <hi>the Spirit, as elſewhere the Spirit and Fire are joyned,</hi> Though the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be inverted there, and he gives the reaſon of it. So <hi>Piſcator,</hi> except a man be born of Water, that is, <hi>ex ſpiritu ſancto, exſerente quaſi vim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae</hi> — Of the holy Spirit, which operates in the ſoul as Water doth in the body, and he alſo referrs to the ſame place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5. Of being Baptized with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and with <hi>Fire.</hi> We have alſo the great <hi>Chamier</hi> arguing the ſame, ſeeing in this ſenſe the words bear an abſolute truth without any limitation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> concludes this with ſporting himſelf at the different grounds upon which the Aſſertors of Infant-Baptiſm hold it out; as the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon one ground, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> upon

               <p>The Author tells us that for ought he could learn <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was the firſt Founder of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for Baptiſm from federal Holineſs, and this indeed he learnt from Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, pag.</hi> 11. whoſe words are — Whether any in the Ages before the laſt paſt expounded it of federal holineſs, I am not yet certain; and in the two laſt lines of page the 79. of his <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> he hath it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> None that ever I met with expounded it of federal Holineſs till the controverſie of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I will ſeek for no other anſwer then what Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> gives him, the cauſe (ſaith he) I confeſs depends not upon this [whether ſuch an interpretation was then firſt put] But it diſcovers ſome defect in your reading, and then ſhews <hi>Athanaſius</hi> one of the moſt Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> one of the moſt Ancient of the <hi>Lattin</hi> Fathers, bring this Text to prove the Prerogative of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers in ſuch a ſenſe as they could not have done, if to their underſtanding it had not related to the Covenant of grace. But to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57924:108"/>the Argument, and let us ſee what is excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>The Argument is this, <hi>viz.</hi> They who are holy with a federal or Covenant holineſs ought to be baptized, But the Infants of Believers are holy, with ſuch a holineſs, <hi>Ergo,</hi> This is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Text, which ſaith [elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.]</p>
               <p>Againſt which it is excepted, that there are two things <hi>in the Argument aſſerted, but not at all proved. Firſt, that the holineſs in the Text is a Federal, or Covenant-holineſs. Secondly, that federal holineſs qualifies Infants for Baptiſm,</hi> both which the Author poſitively denies upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, becauſe the Holineſs in the Text be it what it will be, whether Moral, Federal, or Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, is neither here nor elſewhere, aſſigned to be a ground of Baptizing Children upon; it being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ground laid down in the inſtitution that can warrant the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I reply, That in the firſt part of the Book, chapter the firſt, is ſhewed, how the Infant Seed of Believers are included in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or comprehended in the Commiſſion as baptizable, and being not willing <hi>actum age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> I muſt referr the Reader thither. We have alſo proved that they are of the Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> chap. 6. of the firſt part, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they are likewiſe ſubjects of Baptiſme. Farther, if their holineſs be a Covenant-holineſs, that is, a holineſs of ſpecial ſeparation to God; and he owneth them as his peculiar ones, by
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57924:108"/>virtue of his Cove nant-Relation, this is virtual ly and implicitly a word of command for the Baptizing ſuch In fants, <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up with this note, where is your command? What word of Inſtitution have you to bear you out? To this we have ſpoken enough before, in telling them we have an implicit command for what we do; and farther we offer this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme — They to whom God is a God in Covenant, have a command to receive the ſeale of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. If then the ſame Covenant be given to Believers and their Seed, and if Baptiſm be given to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, inſtead of Circumciſion, as ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in its proper place, then the ſame command which obliged <hi>Abraham</hi> to be Circumciſed, and his ſeed, doth in like manner, the faithful and their ſeed alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if it ſhould be granted that Faederal holineſs were a ground to baptize Children upon, under the Goſpel, as it was to Circumciſe them under the law — yet it will appear from ſubſtantial Arguments that no ſuch holineſs is intended here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us hear what they are; namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe there is no ſuch Holineſs in the new-Teſtament, as Federal, belonging to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well argued! this ſeems to be neer of kin to <hi>idem per idem,</hi> it is not, becauſe it is not. So there is no ſuch holineſs intended in the Text; Why? Becauſe there is no ſuch holineſs in the New Teſtament, and the Text is in the New Teſtament. The matter is well mended in what
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57924:109"/>follows — <hi>It is no where to be found.</hi> This is only a Dictate, for he addeth no reaſon; <hi>It is no where to be found;</hi> But you muſt underſtand he means by himſelf and his party that have made ſuch inquiſition and ſearch into Scripture, that they only have found what is there; what they judge to be the fence of Scripture is ſo, and we muſt all come and learn of them what the Scripture contains, what it implyes and what may be inferred from it, what not. Away with this Popery. But what if I ſay the Covenant holyneſs of Children may be found in this Text? I ſee no reaſon but my word may be be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well as his. Nay, if we muſt go by an implicit faith, we ſhall carry it, for allmoſt all the Godly and Learned Divines in <hi>Europe</hi> have found Covenant-holineſs in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> not only in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. But in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15, 16, 17. where it is ſaid, <hi>if the firſt fruits are boly, ſo is the lump: if the root be holy, ſo are the Branches,</hi> which demonſtrates the Covenant-holineſs of the children of believing Gentiles, now under the Goſpel, as much as of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> children, that deſcended naturally from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> under the Law, but this muſt not be admitted, and why?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it contradicts the Goſpel-Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as before, that is, I ſuppoſe in the firſt part of his Book, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. and I referr the Reader to our Anſwer of that Chapter, to which I adde this by way of ſurpluſage, that if our Children be not federally holy, how could the Apoſtle preſs the <hi>Jews</hi> to imbrace Chriſtianity, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, <hi>The Promiſe is made to you and to your
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57924:109"/>ſeed, and to all that are afar off, even as many as our Lord God ſhall call.</hi> So that to ſay the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Federal holineſs contradicts the Goſpel-diſpenſation, is to contradict the Goſpel which expreſly ſays the contrary, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. Where [mark the words are not the promiſe] [Was] to you, and to your Children, but [is] intimating, that the Covenant is not repealed, but in force ſtill, under the Goſpel-Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as much as ever it was anciently to the <hi>Jews</hi> and their poſterity, and to them that are afar off, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and then to their Children too. even their Infant Children, otherwiſe theſe two abſurdities would follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The grace of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-diſpenſation would be leſs then what it was under the Law, for then the believing Parent with his Children were federally holy, and if it were not ſo now, then ſhould we be in a worſe condition under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then under <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It will render the Children of the Jews alſo in a worſe condition, upon their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then they were in under the legal Adminiſtration, contrary to that, <hi>Jer,</hi> 30.20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.25, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions intails Grace to Nature, Regeneration to Generation, contrary to</hi> John, 3. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> and Eph. 2. <hi>We are all the Children of wrath by Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath been before anſwered, and I ſhall only now ſay, that this is a falſe and fraudulent inſinuation to beget a prejudice in the weak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our aſſertion of federal holineſs, for he knows very well,</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:57924:110"/>
               <p n="1">1. That our Divines hold that <hi>gratia non transfunditur per carnem,</hi> and that grace is not <hi>extraduce,</hi> Grace is not hereditary, that is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Grace: We all ways affirm that all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are alike depraved, and all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are alike conceiv'd in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity, all are Carnal and unclean by nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We farther affirm that though all the Children of Believers are not holy with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent perſonal holyneſs that accompanies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, yet the Children of either believing Parent, are holy with a holineſs-relation put upon them, and ſeparartion to God, as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, by virtue of which, they have a right to the external privileges of the Covenant, whereof they are as capable as the children of the faithful <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is acknowledged even by Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the Children of the Jews were fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally holy, for the whole body of that people (Parents and Children) were called a Holy Seed, a Holy Nation, a peculiar people, and <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the Sinners of the <hi>Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 2.15. And yet this did not intail Grace to Nature, or Regeneration to Generation under the Old Teſtament, and how doth it then do it under the New?</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe it contradicts experience both of former and later times, wherein Godly men have had wicked Children, and wicked men good Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although this be true, yet the Doctrine of federal holineſs remains unſhaken: for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57924:110"/>are not therefore holy, becauſe born of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents [for ſo they are no better then others] but becauſe they are taken with their Parents into Gods gracious Covenant, and have therefore a right as proper ſubjects, to the Seal thereof. Even as the Children of the Godly under the Law; <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> during their Infant-ſtate, were comprehended in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and did partake of the external privilege thereof, Circumciſion, the ſign and Seal of the Covenant, although afterward they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, proving wicked, and ſo diſcovenanted themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He tells us, <hi>The Tenet of Federal holineſs neceſſitates the owning the Docirine of falling from grace;</hi> but this is his miſtake: for the Doctrine of Covenant-holineſs in regard of the Children of Believers, conſiſts very well with perſeverance in <hi>Grace.</hi> For we muſt conſider <hi>Grace</hi> is either <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>ſaving:</hi> The Elect and faithful Seed are only in a State of ſaving Grace, and can never totally fall away, nevertheleſs perſons may fall away from Common-grace, (1.) From the External privileges of the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace. And though we aſſert this latter, yet cannot any man form thence infer, that it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates the owning the Doctrine of falling from grace in the ſenſe of the <hi>Arminians.</hi> We read of ſome who are ſaid to be falſe in Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to Apoſtatize from it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44.17. <hi>Daniel</hi> 11.30, 31. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> bewailes the <hi>Jewes</hi> upon this account <hi>Kom.</hi> 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:57924:111"/>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tomb's</hi> Exerc. fourth Arg. on <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>7.14.</hi> p. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Text,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>intends another,</hi> viz. <hi>a Civil or Matrimonial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in Oppoſition to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Baſtardy,</hi> This is Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> again.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, I might firſt except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impropriety of phraſe, the Anthor u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Matrimonial</hi> holineſs, I have read of <hi>Civil</hi> honeſty, but never of <hi>Civil</hi> holineſs in any <hi>Orthodox</hi> writer. And Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rejects it, I do not like ſaith he, the calling it <hi>Civil</hi> holineſs, for it is not from the laws of men, but the inſtitution of God, and therefore I rather call it Matrimonial holineſs; But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are good.</p>
               <p>It cannot poſſibly be meant of Matrimonial holineſs, as if the ſenſe were this, your children are holy that is Legitimate,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, Holy, is no where ſo taken in all the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is ſuch a Holineſs as that Children could not have, if neither of the Parents were a Believer, or had a ſanctified uſe of the other, which cannot be legitimacie, for that may be as well without that, as with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſuch a holineſs as argues the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving party to be ſanctifyed in, or to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but meer Legitimacy doth not ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be ſuch a holineſs as may anſwer the <hi>Corinthians</hi> doubt, which was not whether when one party came to be a believer, the Marriage with the Unbeliever were diſſolv'd [as the <hi>Author</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:57924:111"/>falſly ſuppoſeth, when he ſaith the Queſtion was, Whether their Spiritual Relation to Chriſt, did not diſſolve their Carnal Relation entered into in Unbelief] But the doubt was, whether they might ſtill perſiſt in ſo neer a Communion with an Unbeliever as Marriage is? Now it had been ſatisfaction to tell them they might, for their Children were not baſtards. They might diſpleaſe God by ſuch a Communion, though their children were not Baſtards. But ſays he, your Believing gives you a holy uſe of your Wife, though an Unbeliever, as appears, becauſe your children born of ſuch are holy, and owned by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as within his Covenant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I might add. The Holineſs in the Text is not put in Oppoſition to Baſtardy; for, that cannot be the ſenſe of the Apoſtle which implies untruth, becauſe then, if one of the Parents had not been a Believer, and ſo by being a Believer had Sanctified the Unbeliever, their children muſt have been Baſtards, whereas though both the Parents had been Infidels, yet the children were not Baſtards, that were begotten in lawful Wedlock.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument to prove it a Holineſs of that kind as he ſuppoſeth, and not federal is, <hi>Becauſe the Holineſs of the Children is of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, then that ſpoke of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Text, and if one will intitle to the Ordinance, ſo the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Author dictates, and ſince he brings no proof, for what he ſays, I may as well deny it, and ſay no more. Nevertheleſs I ſhall give a reaſon to prove the holineſs of the children is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57924:112"/>other then that ſpoken of the unbelieving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Namely, becauſe the children here are ſaid to be holy in themſelves, But the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving [Whether Husband or Wife] is only ſaid to be ſanctified in, or to the believing Yoak-fellow, as all other creatures; the meat he eats, the cloaths he wears are ſanctified; None of which are holy in themſelves, but only in reference to the believer — <hi>quoad ejus uſum,</hi> to his uſe and ſervice, and therefore cannot be called holy, but the children in the Text are ſaid to be holy in themſelves and not ſanctified or made holy to another. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>New England</hi> is full to the ſame purpoſe in his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue about Baptiſm.</hi> Though the word San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed and holy come of the ſame Root, ſaith he, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſeth them here in ſuch a different phraſe or manner of ſpeech, as putteth a manifeſt difference in the ſenſe or ſignification of them. For when he ſaith, the Unbelieving Yoak-fellow is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he doth not leave it ſo, without a limitation or reſtriction, but joyneth the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Sanctified in or to the believer, and that limiteth the ſence to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers uſe, But when he ſpeaketh of Children he doth it not with ſuch limitation, they are holy to the Believer, but Poſitively they are holy.</p>
               <p>The Author ſhuts up this with another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Holineſs ſpoken of the unbelieving Parent, and the Child being of the ſame Nature, then if one will intitle to the Ordinance, ſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:57924:112"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſito uno abſurdo mille ſequuntur. One abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity laid down, draws an innumerable train af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</hi> The Holineſs is not one and the ſame as before, and therefore cannot entitle to the ſame privileges. And beſides, I add, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was not made with the Believer and his Yoak-fellow, but with him, and his Seed, and therefore the one hath a right to the Ordinance of Baptiſm, the other not.</p>
               <p>The third Argument, <hi>(ſuch as it is) is from the conſideration that children in the Text is not to be limited to Infants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> again, Examen p. <hi>73.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>or ſuch children that they might have ſince the Religious difference happened, but of grown children, for a mans Child is his Child, though thirty, forty, or fifty years old,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Tis wonderful to behold the ſhifts of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, This is old <hi>Tombes</hi> again, <hi>Exam. pag.</hi> 73.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57924:113"/>been to be ſo reputed, had not one of them turned Believer. Secondly, The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then born after one of them was turned Chriſtian is unqueſtionably that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intends, and if ſo, then Children is moſt rationally to be limited to Infant Children, ſuch as ſhould be or had been newly born upon their Parents Believing, for we may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſcruple aroſe preſently after converſion, about cohabitation and converſe with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel-Yoak-fellows, and whether it were not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious (not Fornication as <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weakly ſuppoſe) for the Believer to procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with the Infidel.</p>
               <p>His fourth Argument why it cannot be a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Holineſs that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and intitles to Baptiſm is —</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>I perceive the Authors ſtrength is almoſt ſpent. His reaſon runs low, and is near come to the dreggs; for what doth this his arguing amount to? ſhall we not find thoſe who are for Baptizing grown perſons, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith in the ſame praedicament? may not theſe be Hypocrits alſo, and not in Covenant, and if ſo, do they not Baptize a wrong ſubject? When therefore they have cleared this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for themſelves they have done it for us, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it be the reality of Faith and Holineſs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57924:113"/>in grown perſons that qualifies for Baptiſm, then none muſt be Baptized, becauſe this cannot be known; but if it be ſaid a ſerious profeſſion is ſufficient [for, <hi>De occultis non judicat Eccleſia, The Church judgeth not of ſecret or hidden things</hi>] Then the ſame alſo is ſufficient for the Infants of <hi>ſuch</hi> ſo profeſſing. The diſtinction which is uſed by Divines may give light in this point, namely, there is an external being in Covenant, <hi>in facie viſibilis Eccleſiae,</hi> in the eſteem and judgement of the Church, and that is viſible Profeſſion or Holyneſs, and this gives right to viſible priviledges, 2. There is an internal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant, in regard of the ſpiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits of it; and it is out of the reach of the Church to judge of this latter. I ſhall ſhut up this with the words of Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> in his <hi>Defence of Infant-Baptiſm, pag.</hi> 108. <hi>viz.</hi> When therefore I ſay they [Infants] are viſibly to be reckoned to belong to the Covenant with their Parents.

Now I conceive the <hi>Author</hi> himſelf will confeſs that the ſpiritual part and privileges of the Covenant of Grace belongs not to viſible Profeſſors, as <hi>viſible,</hi> but only to ſuch among them who are inwardly ſuch as their external profeſſion holds out, but yet there are <hi>outward Church privileges,</hi>

               <p>Firſt ſuppoſe it be ſo [He is no farther yet then a ſuppoſe] that the word ſignifies, that, in all thoſe places but this, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>[But now are they holy)</hi> it follows not but it may have this ſenſe properly enough here, the ſcope of the place leading to it? as <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>No wonder that Hereticks are ſo inflexible when even good men, (ſuch as I hope both Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and this <hi>Author</hi> are) will wrangle at this rate, <hi>&amp; ſomnem movere lapidem,</hi> try every way rather then be thought to erre in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits: and where this humour is predominant, men were better be ſilent, and not diſpute at all, for it puts an abuſe upon the Scripture, and renders Religion not only ridiculous but turns it into a Fire brand of contention. Thus our Author being unwilling to part with his fond notion of the word, Holy, in the Text, doth I fear prophanely abuſe the Scripture, by flying to this old ſhift of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> grounded upon a miſtake of the ſcope of the Text as is before ſhewn, for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> doubt was whether it was ſinful to cohabit with their Infidel Yoak-fellows, and not whither is was fornication to live with them. It will not be amiſs to give you the reply that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> made to <hi>Tombes,</hi> when he urged that though the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> doth in all other places ſignifie authority or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57924:117"/>power, yet in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. it is rendred a <hi>Vail.</hi> To which ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if God do no where in all Scripture call the meer making a thing lawful (the ſanctifying it) but many hundred times uſe the word in another ſenſe; then we muſt not call it, nor ſo interpret him here, but God doth no where in Scripture call the meer making a thing lawful (the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) therefore we muſt not do ſo, nor here ſo interpret it. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> granted the Antecedent, but denying the conſequence, ſaid, that though God did not ſo uſe the word, yet we might, and though he uſe it five hundred times otherwiſe, yet we muſt ſo interpret him here</p>
               <p>To which, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I am reſolv'd to learn of God how to ſpeak rather then you, and to follow Scripture phraſe as near as I can, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I muſt follow the Author —</p>

               <p>Firſt, For that in <hi>Malachy</hi> it hath no neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it; for <hi>Godly</hi> or of God is not the ſame with <hi>Holy:</hi> nor doth he ſay that all Seed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in lawful Marriage of one to one, is a Godly Seed: But that he might ſeek a ſeed of God; that ſo he might have a Church proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from orderly and chaſte marriage. Mr. <hi>Gerre</hi> hath cleared this very well in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae Paedobaptiſmi.</hi> The place in <hi>Malachy,</hi> ſaith he, to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> doth not any thing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance your conceit, that <hi>Holy</hi> is taken for <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate:</hi> not only becauſe that place is capable of another ſenſe then to import a Legitimate Seed, but if it be taken for Legitimate, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that Holy and Legitimate are one; Holy is a higher ſtate then Legitimate, both are from Gods Ordination; <hi>Seed</hi> in both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be termed a Seed of God, as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is there, and yet they be different, and ſo though a Seed of God be tranſlated Legitimate, yet it follows not that holy is taken for Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p>Then for that place in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 23.17. This makes it more unlikely, ſaith the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Author, for though Baſtards were once Legally unclean, yet that was a Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing, that was abrogated when the Apoſtle wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and for the Apoſtle then in that ſenſe to ſay Baſtards were unclean, was neither true, nor ſafe, for it were a reviving again the Ceremonial Law. And for the other Text, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. where <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the ſame with Chaſtity, Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> did not fly to a ſhift, when he told <hi>Tombes,</hi> that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57924:118"/>Chaſtity among the Heathens is never called Sanctification, but among Believers it is, being a part of the New-Creation, and one branch and part of their Sanctification wrought by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; for the Apoſtle here writes to the Saints to take heed of that ſin to which, whilſt they were in their Infidel State, they were much given up to. Chaſtity indeed amongſt Infidels we call a moral virtue, but cannot properly be called a part of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (which is the laſt reaſon the <hi>Author</hi> brings, I ſhould have ſaid Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi>) <hi>Neither can Matrimonial holineſs be ſaid not to be a Separation to God;</hi>

                  <hi>for it is no other then ſetting a part according to Gods Ordinance, and which is called honourable</hi> (or in this ſenſe <hi>holy</hi>) &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> had been ingenious if he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us all that Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſaith upon this — for he flyes to the Engliſh Liturgy for help; I may adde, ſaith he, that Marriage hath had the reputation of a <hi>holy eſtate,</hi> as the Liturgy calls it.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which this may ſuffice, it is a chaſte eſtate, but for the term <hi>holineſs</hi> to be given to it, it is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be the Iſſue of a ſuppoſed Sacrament,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Geree</hi> Vinditiae Paedollapt.</note> ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by the Papiſts, and this may occaſion ſome Epethites given to it, which are yet retained, that ought to be laid aſide.</p>

But thou wilt find <hi>Reader,</hi> that he tenders nothings to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a nauſeous <hi>Crambe,</hi> a Repetition of the old routed Arguments; and indeed the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie hath been ſo much bandied too and fro, that without a miraculous invention, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find out any thing <hi>New,</hi> either <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> and the utmoſt that can be done, is but to improve the <hi>Old</hi> Arguments.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57924:119"/>The foundation upon which we ground our practice, is Gods Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. from whence (ſaith he) it is thus argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <hi>Thoſe to whom the Goſpel-Covenant belonged to them, the Seal thereof appertained: But to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and their ſeed the Goſpel Covenant belonged,</hi> as Gen. 17.7. <hi>I'le be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> Acts 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you and to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, We have the expreſs Teſtimony of Scripture for it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Tenor</hi> of it ſpeaks it a Covenant of Grace, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="3">3. Though this Covenant be but one, yet all are not in it after one and the ſame manner, ſome are in it only by participation of external Church

               <p n="4">4. The whole body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they deſcended from the Loyns of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, and before they were Regenerated, were according to Scripture Teſtimony taken by God into Covenant, and were ſo eſteemed by God himſelf in one reſpect or other: Hence God ſaith he, made his Covenant with them all, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. ſpeaking there, of the renewing of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>verſe</hi> 10.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>

Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions argue, that in ſome ſenſe they muſt be in and under the Covenant; that is, in regard of external privileges only; for it is certain, they were never in it efficaciouſly, and ſavingly as the Elect, choice ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for then they could never have fallen away; they were in it in regard of external Covenant-privileges, and common graces, which Hypocrites and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates may partake of; and in this very ſenſe Chriſt ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews</hi> collectively, calls them, <hi>The Children of the Kingdom, Matthew</hi> 8. and the Apoſtle, the Children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

The firſt Text is that in the 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 16, <hi>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promiſes made, he ſaith not to Seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy Seed which is Chriſt. And if ye be Chriſts, then are you Abrahams Seed;</hi> v. 29. <hi>The other is</hi> Rom. 9.7, 8. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham, are they

And</hi> Rom. 4.13. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be Heir of the World, was not to Abraham, or to his Seed through the Law, but through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> the <hi>Author,</hi> and all the party conclude, that, <hi>the Seed to whom the Covenant belongs, is the Spiritual, and not the Carnal.</hi> Not being born after the fleſh, but believing that makes us children of the promiſe.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57924:125"/>he and none elſe ſhould be concerned in the promiſes: But it is to be underſtood of Chriſt <hi>myſtical,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> there notes, <hi>Apoſtolus eo nomine non ſolum caput, ſed membra cum ſuo capite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignans,</hi> the Apoſtle by the word Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting both Head, and Members. <hi>Capnt, &amp; Corpus unus eſt Chriſtus,</hi> the Head and the Body make up one myſtical Chriſt: the word Chriſt being to be taken collectively in this place, ſo we have it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. to which <hi>Beza</hi> refers. And if this be the ſence of it, as what elſe can rationally? then as Mr. <hi>Sydenbam</hi> notes, this Text will make rather for us, than againſt us, for if we exclude all Infants from being of the Body of Chriſt; we muſt in ſo doing unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably exclude them from Salvation, for he is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to no more than he is head of, which is his Body. As for the words in the nine and twentieth verſe, that will afford the <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſts</hi> little relief: the words are, <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams Seed, and Heirs according to promiſe,</hi> from whence, ſaith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Author, they argue, the Apoſtle here deſcribes who are the Seed, ſo that now no children born of believing parents can be the Seed, for they muſt be Chriſts according to that v. 16. <hi>We are all the children of God through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But let ſuch underſtand what <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith on the place, namely that the <hi>Claramontanus</hi> Bible hath the words thus, and he thinks more right <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>If you be one in Chriſt, then are ye Abrahams Seed:</hi> which comports well with the former verſe <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57924:125"/>free, &amp;c. but ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and if ye be all one, then Abrahams Seed.</hi> From which</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is clear that the Deſign of the Apoſtle is to take away all difference between Jew and Gentile, and to hodl forth their unity in Chriſt, and that this is the very ſcope of the place <hi>Beza</hi> ſhews fully in his Annotations upon it, and that now there is no diſtinction betwivt them as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: But the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are become <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, as well as the natural and believing <hi>Jews. Quod unius Seminis nomine collectivo ſignificatur,</hi> as before in the ſixteenth verſe, which is pointed out to us by the collective name of <hi>one Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle here hath no intent to ſhew the diſtinction of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed as the Subject of the outward priviledges and adminiſtrations of Ordinances, but to ſhew that none are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and really <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and Heirs of promiſe, but ſuch as are Chriſts, one in him with <hi>Abraham:</hi> for if this ſhould be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Seed as the ſubject of outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, it would be as much againſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Believers as Infants: for the propoſition from this Text, as our Oppoſites draw it, is thus: none but thoſe who are <hi>Chriſts</hi> are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Seed, and none are <hi>Chriſts</hi> but real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and therefore none but they muſt be baptized. But how weak is this? 1. Becauſe if none but ſuch are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently none but ſuch the ſubjects of Baptiſm, then viſible Believers are not the ſubjects of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, for they may not be Chriſts, no more than Infants. 2. None muſt be baptized at all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57924:126"/>upon this account, for who knows who is Chriſts according to Election and ſaving Faith? To ſay we have charitable grounds to believe viſible profeſſors are Chriſts, till we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is not to the queſtion as ſtated, nor as it lies in the Text: the Text ſaith, <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then ye are Abrahams Seed:</hi> they ſay none are in Chriſt but real Believers,<note place="margin">See Chapter the fifth of the firſt part of the Authors Treatiſe.</note> and none muſt be baptized but the ſpiritual Seed, and that will require not only a judgment of charity, but infallibility to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. And beſides the Apoſtle is deſcribing here what the real and ſpiritual Seed are, as having an inward right to Chriſt, and not what the apparent Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was, for he ſpeaks to the <hi>Galathians</hi> who were viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and Believers then in appearance, and he puts them upon a trial of themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Chriſts or no. I have been the larger in quoting ſomething from <hi>Beza,</hi> but more from Mr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> who ſpeaks abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of reaſon, that you may ſee how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly this Text is abuſed by our Oppoſites. And how far wide it is from the purpoſe, for which they uſually bring it.</p>
               <p>Now for that other place, <hi>Ram.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>They that are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> What do they gather from hence? Why, that Infants becauſe children of the fleſh, are not under the promiſe: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is well argued. for this is to make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle contradict himſelf in the ſame breath,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57924:126"/>for the Text ſaith, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi> Now that was a child of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, and yet a child of promiſe too. And from hence iſſueth three undeniable Propoſitions, as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> noteth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual Seed were as much his fleſhly Seed alſo, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Proſelytes and Servants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant was adminiſtred to all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> natural and fleſhly children, as if they had been his ſpiritual, and before they knew what faith was, or could actually profeſſs <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When there is mention of <hi>Abrahams</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seed in oppoſition to his ſpiritual Seed, it cannot be meant primarily, or ſolely of thoſe that deſcended from his fleſh, for then <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were the carnal Seed, yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who as concerning the fleſh came of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> It muſt be therefore underſtood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of thoſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed which degener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and ſlighted the Covenant of the Goſpel, ſuch as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and ſuch of whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.2.3. his Brethren and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after the fleſh, whoſe condition he bewails, which was the generality of the body of the <hi>Jews;</hi> or</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some conceive by children of the fleſh, he meaneth not in this place children by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, but ſuch as truſted in outward fleſhly priviledges, and by children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe put in oppoſition to them, is meant true Believers, which are indeed the true Seed, in whom the word takes effect, and who were

So that the Apoſtles expreſs Doctrine is, that Election and Salvation is not from works, but free Grace. But the Oppoſerss of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, have always perverted the ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, of outward Church priviledges, not to be had by being born of believing Parents, which the Text has nothing to do with, as every unpartial and judicious Reader will apprehend. Nay this very place proves the quite contrary, for the Apoſtle makes two ſorts to be within the viſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Some are of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is in mans cyc: theſe partake of the outward priviledges, <hi>v.</hi> 4.5. Others are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is the true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed, that belongs to Gods Election, and obtain the ſaving Promiſe. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. The Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with him, is the ſame for ſubſtance
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57924:127"/>with that we live under, and as perſons were under it then, ſo is it now: it is not ſtreighter now, and larger then, but the ſame. And the like appears, verſe 14. and 17. the Identity of the Covenant is there manifeſt, which is a truth deſtructive to the Opinion of Antipaedobaptiſts, and therefore they ſo ſtrike at it.</p>
               <p>Having thus examined the Expoſitions, which according to his Imagination, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf puts upon the [Seed] ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and diſcovered his great miſtake. I could do it too very fully as to moſt of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors following, which he ſaith, do give in their concurrent ſence with his, upon the Text.</p>
               <p>The firſt named is <hi>Calvin</hi> upon: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. who ſaith, <hi>that it is manifeſt that the promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſpiritual Bleſſing, pertaineth not to the Carnal Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>but to the Spiritual as the Apoſtle himſelf ſaith, Rom.</hi> 4.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this I find the Author guilty of ſhameful <hi>Oſcitancie,</hi> and it is intollerable for any man thus to impoſe his miſtakes upon the Reader. The words are not <hi>Calvins,</hi> but <hi>Eſtius</hi> his Anſwer to <hi>Calvin;</hi> who again and again in his Comment upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. aſſerts the promiſe to be made to <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural and fleſhly Seed, and to all of them—for thus he ſaith, <hi>Nunc videndum eſt quem populum deſignet. Falluntur autem qui pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſolos hic electos notari</hi>—They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived who think it to be meant only of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Again, <hi>clara eſt Pauli Doctrina de naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Abrahoe filiis, quod ſint Sancti rami, quia ex ſancta radice prodierint, Rom.</hi> 11.16. the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews clearly 'tis underſtood of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57924:128"/>the natural children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</p>
               <p>Then afterward: <hi>Quare nihil certius eſt, quàm Deum foedus ſuum paciſci cum filiis Abrahae, qui naturaliter ex eo gignendi erant.</hi> Wherefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain than that God made his Covenant with the children, which were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be begotten of him. And then anſwers the Objections that may be made againſt it from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Neque repugnat quod dicit Paulus.</hi> The cauſe of this miſtake in our Author is meer careleſneſs, for he never examined <hi>Calvin,</hi> but finds in Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Examen: pag.</hi> 50. This paſſage quoted by him, <hi>viz. Eſtius annot. ad Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Colligit hìnc Calvinus eo ipſo quo quis eſt ſemen Abrahae, ad eum pertinere promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonem Abrahae factam:</hi> that is, hence <hi>Calvin</hi> gathers, that the promiſe—belonged to the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> as they were his natural or carnal Seed. To which <hi>Eſtius</hi> replies—thus —<hi>Reſponſio manifeſta; promiſſionem illam de bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione ſpirituali intellectam non ad carnale ſemen Abrahami pertinere, ſed ad ſpirituale quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eam ipſe Apoſtolus interpretatus eſt Rom.</hi> 4.9. —Which is according to the Authors Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation — It is manifeſt that the promiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dood of ſpiritual bleſſings, pertaineth not to the carnal Seed, &amp;c. here I might paſs ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon this miſtake of the Author. 1. That he is very careleſs in quoting Authors, and taking one for another, and that the teſtimony he cites for himſelf is againſt him. 2. That he and his party, and the Jeſuites and Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree very well in the interpretation of thoſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57924:128"/>Scriptures that relate to the Covenant. The Author lies open to the laſh alſo in what he quotes out of <hi>Ameſius, de praedeſt.</hi> For <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſpeaks but juſt half of what he ſets down, in one and the ſame character, and the promiſe that he diſputes of there againſt the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, is that in the ninth of <hi>Romans</hi> 8. So that it is not <hi>ad idem,</hi> for we are ſpeaking of that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. God ſaid indeed he would not eſtabliſh his Covenant with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 17.27. but by Covenant there is not meant the Covenant we ſtand in to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our perſons, for our own perſonal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, but the Covenant of ſpecial Prerogative to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould come of, and the Church remain in his poſterity.</p>
               <p>Next folows the diſmal Conſequences, which, as he ſaith, the Doctrine of Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is attended with. But they are only i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary, not real ones. <hi>Quicquid recipitur recipitur ad modum recipientis;</hi> as the man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo the Bell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let us hear what they are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If God made his Covenant with the Poſterity of Believers, as this Doctrine aſſerts, then ſaith he, all the Poſterity of Believers ſhould certainly have grace beſtowed upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> No ſuch matter, for we have proved they may be ſaid to be in Covenant, in regard of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal prividledges only; and not partake of the ſpiritual grace, or ſaving benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake <hi>doth confidently affirm, p.</hi> 6. <hi>ſaying, that Chriſtianity is hereditary,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57924:129"/>that as the child of a Noble man is noble, the child of a Free man free, a Turk a Turk and of a Jew, a Jew, ſo the child of a Chriſtian, is a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray Sir, who told you this of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> was it not your old friend Mr. <hi>Tombes Exercit.</hi> p. 53. your words differ very little. If this be true ſaith <hi>Tombs,</hi> that the Covenant of grace is a Birth-right priviledge, then the children of Believers are children of Grace by nature, for that which is a Birth-right privilege is a priviledge by nature, and if as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 6. to [but neither of them names the Book] Chriſtianity is hereditary, that as the child of a Noble man is noble, the child of a Turk is a Turk, of a Jew a Jew, the child of a Chriſtian is a Chriſtian, then ſaith <hi>Tombes</hi> [juſt as my Antagoniſt] Chriſtians are born Chriſtians. O wonderful, that men ſhould ſo agree! And how are they then, ſaith he, the children of wrath by nature? and ſaith our Author this is in contradiction [thats ſome alteration] to the Scripture which ſaith we are children of wrath. One would think theſe men did very well agree, they do ſo often meet and kiſs each other, but tis in <hi>aliquo tertio,</hi> that is, in the point of Baptiſm, for I hear from thoſe that knows them both <hi>intùs &amp; in cute,</hi> that they are at a great, if not irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance in ſome other matter: But I would have the reader to underſtand that thoſe words are not <hi>Blakes,</hi> though charg'd upon him by Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> to render him odious, which is very ſad: And that learned godly man being very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the injury, ſignifies to <hi>Tombes</hi> that he diſowns it, and adviſeth him to forbear ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57924:129"/>I believe, ſaith he, no ſuch thing that Parents conveigh to their <hi>children,</hi> as by Birth-priviledge, a being in Chriſt Jeſus, but if you underſtand by Chriſtianity the bare name or title of Chriſtian, together with a right to Church priviledges, then I ſhall own the thing, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the expreſſion: A ſufficient vindication from ſo ſordid a Calumny, and if this were ſo unworthily done in Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> what ſhall we think of the Author. who hath lick'd up that vomit again, and caſt it upon Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> after he had ſo well cleared himſelf, which he could not but know.</p>
               <p>Nor doth our Doctrine contradict thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which ſaywe are children of wrath by nature, and except a man be born again, &amp;c. <hi>Joh,</hi> 3.3. for even all the Elect are born ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> children of wrath, and yet they are the children of promiſe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf was viſibly the child of promiſe in his infancy, he was born by promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.8, 9. and yet in reſpect of natural generation, he was a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> a child of wrath.</p>
               <p>Another Abſurdity he fancies,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> again.</note> is, <hi>That then all the poſterity of Believers muſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſaved, without,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you will neceſſitate the Doctrine of falling from grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Down right Mr. <hi>Tombes Exerc. p.</hi> 52. if God keeps his Covenant, it follows that all the poſterity of Believers are ſaved, or if ſome are not ſaved, though they be in the Covenant of grace, there may be Apoſtacy of perſons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> for the Covenant of Grace is not abſolute, and ſaving to all that are once within it; it is abſolute &amp; ſaving to the Elect
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57924:130"/>Seed, but not to thoſe who partake of the out ward priviledges of it, but take not hold of it by faith. It may truly be ſaid of all Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants born of believing Parents, that they are abſolutely under the Covenant: (as <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his Infancy) even before they believe,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Grounds and Ends of childrens Baptiſm. Dr. <hi>Proſton</hi> of the Covenant.</note> yea their believing in Gods time is given to them as the effect, and not the cauſe of the Covenant; But as for others who only partake of the outward priviledges of it, and no more, that do not believe, it is not ſaving to them.</p>
               <p>As for the other diſmal Conſequence of <hi>Falling from Grace,</hi> which they ſay we muſt hold, if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers be in Covenant, and not all ſaved.</p>
               <p>This is like the reſt; the fear is more than the hurt; for as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſaith, whom ſoever God taketh into Covenant are in a State of Grace, but what Grace? either <hi>common</hi> or <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace. The Elect are in a ſtate of <hi>ſaving</hi> Grace, and they ſhall never totally fall away, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may fall away from a ſtate of common Grace, and from the external priviledges of the Goſpel, &amp; Covenant of Grace <hi>quatenus</hi> it reſpects outward ſpiritual priviledges. Thoſe that ſtick at this, and will not own it for Truth may do well to give us the ſence of thoſe Scriptures, <hi>pſal.</hi> 44.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.30, 31. Where they are ſaid to be falſe in Gods Covenant, and to apoſtatize from it.</p>
               <p>Another diſmal conſequence, which is only
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57924:130"/>the reſult of an idle and erroneous conceit is, <hi>That we tie up the Groce of Gods Covenant to the children of Believers only, and then what hope for the children of unbelievers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No fear of that, for the children of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may belong to the Election of Gods Grace, but have no right to be baptized, but upon their own perſonal profeſſion, nor are the children of thoſe who are called Chriſtians to be ranck'd with the children of Pagans (for they are in a nearer capacity of Salvation, being born in a nation where the Goſpel is preached) of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, who being ſtrangers to the Covenant, are ſaid to be without hope: Laſtly, he ſaith our <hi>Doctrine overthrows the Covenant of Grace it ſelf, concluding an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt without faith, and deriving a Title by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>The other Scripture that he encounters with, is that <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. A parallel place to that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. The Argument which we bring for Infant Baptiſm from hence is this,</p>
               <p>Thoſe to whom the promiſe doth belong, to them belongs Baptiſm, but to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and their children the promiſe belongs, therefore to them and their children belongs Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Againſt this he hath a double Exception.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By the promiſe there, is not meant the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace but the giving of the Spirit, called the promiſe of the Father, prophecied of by</hi> Joel 2.28.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer, That though in the fourth and ſeventeenth verſe. Whereis men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, which refers to <hi>Joels</hi> Prophecy, yet the promiſe in the eight and thirtieth verſe is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not meant of thoſe extraordinary Gifts; for</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſuch a promiſe as is ſtill a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, and ſhall be throughout all the times of the New Teſtament, paralled to that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit on thy Seed, and my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on thy Off-ſpring.</hi> It is ſuch a promiſe as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to Parents, and to their children, and all that ſhall be called to the end of the world, whereas the promiſe of extraordinary Gifts,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57924:132"/>was but <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for a certain time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to that ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It cannot be underſtood of extraordinary Gifts, becauſe <hi>Peters</hi> hearers had no ſuch Gifts nor had the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were afar off, and afterward called ſuch miraculous Gifts; and as Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> notes, if the promiſe <hi>(to you, and to your children)</hi> be meant of extraordinary Gifts, how will the parts of the Text agree with each other? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts them, <hi>be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> and then gives this reaſon, <hi>For the promiſe is to you and to your children.</hi> If therefore the promiſe be meant of extraordinary Gifts, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>be baptized every one of you,</hi> will ſtand in immediate relation to ſuch a promiſe. And ſo the matter will come to this Iſſue, that all that are baptized: and particularly they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their old, to take up a new Baptiſm, they will have a promiſe made to them, and to their children to ſpeak with diverſe kinds of languages. [Which promiſe I never underſtood-was made good amongſt them, for few of them have any more than their Mother Tongue.] On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, if the promiſe be taken for the promiſe of Chriſt, and for remiſſion of ſin by his blood, in this caſe it will be eaſie to ſhew the connexion of the words; for what can be more aptly ſpoken than this? <hi>Be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſion of your particular ſin? for the promiſe of the pardon of ſin, by the blood of Chriſt doth belong to you and to your children?</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The promiſe here mentioned was to give hope to thoſe poor creatures, and to prevent the deſpair, which they were ready to fall into up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conviction, that they had crucified the Lord of Life, and what comfort could this bring to their wounded conſciences, to tell them they ſhould have the miraculous gifts of tongues?</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis farther objected, <hi>by children are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meant than the poſterity of the Jews.</hi>

               <p>It is true what the <hi>Author</hi> ſaith concerning Dr. <hi>Hamond,</hi> that he conceives children to be there really the poſterity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not particularly their Infant children, but that is but one Doctors Opinion in oppoſition to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable

The conſideration of the practice of the Church in baptizing Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents, pag.</hi> 48.49.</hi> It is, ſaith he, in our caſe as it was with the Jews children, our children are a <hi>holy Seed:</hi> for if it were not ſo with Chriſtianity, how could S. <hi>Peter</hi> move the Jews to Chriſtianity, by telling them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was to them and their children? For if our children be not capable of the Spirit of promiſe, and holineſs, and yet their children were holy; it had been a better Argument to have kept them in the Synagogue, than to have called them to the Chriſtian Church — And indeed if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Jews, whoſe children are circumciſed, and made partakers of the ſame promiſes, title, and inheritance, and Sacrament, which themſelves had at their firſt converſion to the faith of Chriſt, had ſeen their children ſhut out from the new Sacrament [of Baptiſm] it is not to be doubted but they would have raiſed a ſtorm, greater than could eaſily be ſuppreſſed: ſince about their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion they had raiſed ſuch tragedies, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable diſputations; and there had been great reaſon to look for a ſtorm; for their children were <hi>circumciſed,</hi> and if not <hi>baptized;</hi> then they were left under a burthen, which their fathers were quit of, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto you, <hi>whoſoever is circumciſed is a debtor to keep the

But why, ſaith Dr. <hi>Sclater,</hi> ſhould circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion be a Seal to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, and not to others as well as him? was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or with his Seed alſo? or was Circumciſion a ſign of the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, or elſe to his Seed alſo? if the Covenant belong to [all] if Circumciſion was to [all] a ſign of their being in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, why not to [all] alſo a Seal of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Forſooth, ſay the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> one end of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion was peculiar to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as that he ſhould be the father of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, therefore this alſo of being a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And I wonder why we may not conclude by like reaſon, that to <hi>Abraham</hi> only it was a Sin of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57924:135"/>becauſe this end they mention had place in <hi>Abraham</hi> only? But let us more nearly view the reaſons; it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> privilege only to be the father of all Believers, both circumciſed, and uncircumciſed, <hi>ergo</hi> his privilege only to have circumciſion a Seal of righteouſneſs: how prove they that conſequence?

But for fuller ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, view the ſcope of the <hi>Text,</hi> which is this; to ſhew that juſtification belongs to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of both people: the proof is from a ſign: <hi>Abraham had righteouſneſs in uncircumciſion,</hi> therefore righteouſneſs belongs to the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; for this was that the Lord myſtically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſignifie in juſtifying of <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Circumciſion, and in commending Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to him juſtifyed: but why doth he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that end of Circumciſion as ſealing up the righteouſneſs of faith? <hi>Anſw.</hi> To obviate an objection which might be made in this manner: if <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified before Circumciſion, what profit received he by that Sacrament? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſealed unto him the righteouſneſs of faith: and ſhall we ſay now it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> privilege to be confirmed in perſwaſion of righteouſneſs? belike then his poſterity, either needed not ſuch confirmation, and ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> privilege ſhall be to be the only weakling in faith, that needs means of confirmation, or elſe his Seed ſhall lack that help that <hi>Abraham</hi> had for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57924:135"/>though the Covenant was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to them. Thus far Dr. <hi>Sclater,</hi> and I repent not may pains, he hath ſo cleared the point that I know not what either Papiſt, or Antipaedobaptiſt can ſay againſt it. I ſhall add that which every one will ſubſcribe to, that the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood in much more need of a Seal to confirm their faith, then he himſelf with whom the Covenant was originally made, and for that reaſon was called the father of the faithful, as well as for the eminency of his faith.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the initiatory Seal is not primarily and properly the Seal of a mans faith, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but of Gods Covenant, rather. The Seal is to the Covenant, even <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was not primarily a Seal to <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith of righteouſneſs, but to the righteouſneſs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57924:137"/>Faith, exhibited and effected in the Covenant, yea to the Covenant it ſelf, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved unto righteouſneſs; hence the Covenant of Grace is called the righteouſneſs of Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I farther anſwer, that 'tis granted, Infants have not actually the uſe of Faith, but to that end was Circumciſion adminiſtred to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Jews (as Baptiſm is now to our Infants) that when in time to come they ſhould believe to righteouſneſs (as all the Elect, who live to age do) their Faith might receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by their Circumciſion in Infancy, and this was that which heightned <hi>David</hi>'s confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his encounter with <hi>Goliah,</hi> reflecting upon Gods Covenant, of which the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion which he received in his Infancy, was a ſign and a Seal.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <hi>Neither is Baptiſm more than Circumciſion called a Seal, it is ſign proper only to men of underſtanding, repreſenting ſpiritual Myſteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> And why not as proper to Infants, as to men of underſtanding? <hi>becauſe they repreſent ſpiritual Myſteries;</hi> and if this be all the reaſon he can give, he might better have ſaid nothing: for what thinks he of Circumciſion, did not that repreſent and ſhadow out diverſe ſpiritual Myſteries, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> our corrruption by nature, and the nature of mortification [by cutting of the foreskin.] Was not the glorious myſtery of our Redemption by the blood of Chriſt ſignified by the blood-ſhed in Circumciſion, and yet this Ordinance was applyed to poor ignorant Babes, to uſe the Authors Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57924:137"/>and how ſlightly ſo ever he ſpeaks of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of like reſemblance for ſignification yet the wiſdom of God thought fit to have thoſe circumciſed that were void of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. I find the Author and his party too bold in cenſuring of things, that do any way croſs their idol-opinion; and the wiſdom of God himſelf ſhall ſuffer, rather than they will recede from the errour they have ſuck'd in, yea, 'its obſervable that ſome of them are as perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, and inflexible in their principle of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Infant-Baptiſm, and lay out as much zeal in this matter, as if their Salvation were concern'd in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And not as Circumciſion which was a Sign not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for Infants,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It is true, Circumciſion left a ſignal mark upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants, but what of that? had they any other way to know this mark was given them for any ſuch religious end, and purpoſe, as a ſign or ſeal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt God and them, but by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others? For inſtance, ſuppoſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant born blind (as we read of ſuch a one in the Goſpel) was circumciſed, who could never ſee that <hi>ſignal</hi> mark, he muſt be beholding to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both to be taught the religous end of Circumciſion, as well as to have intimation of the character he received in Circumeiſion. It is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57924:138"/>well known that the ſame Ceremony is uſed by other nations (though not as a Sacrament) as the Inhabitants of <hi>Colchis,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> therefore when grown up, had no other way to know that ſignal mark was given to a religious purpoſe (which was the principal end that Ordinance pointed at) than by the information of their Parents, or other witneſſes. And the Jewiſh Doctors tell us there was one appointed for that purpoſe, whoſe name they called <hi>Baal Berith,</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dak,</hi> that is the Maſter of the Covenant, and to this ſence <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> interprets that in <hi>Iſaiah chap.</hi> 8.2. where 'tis ſaid <hi>that he took unto him faithful witneſſes,</hi> viz. <hi>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57924:138"/>good things which at his Baptiſm they promiſed, or undertook for his, as appeareth by the charge given to the Sureties. I ſhall add that the ſame Office may be much mere needful in caſe the childs Parents dye, before it comes to years of diſcretion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Except. <hi>Circumciſion was not adminiſtred to Believers, as Believers, and to their Seed, but according to the Inſtitution, to all the natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage and Poſterity of Abraham, good or bad.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> In which paſſage, there are two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtkes, for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Believer, and was not Circumciſion adminiſtred to him, as a Believer, and to his Seed?</p>
               <p>The whole body of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> profeſſing the worſhip of the true God wer accounted Believers, and all the world beſides, <hi>Infidels, without God,</hi> and <hi>afar off, Eph.</hi> 2.12, 17.

And God owns them as his. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15. And all upon account of the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, and 'tis upon the account of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat of free-grace that any among the ſons of men are the people of God. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>All were not Iſrael that were of Iſrael,</hi> all were not godly, by virtue of Election, and Regeneration; there were many of them his people, nay, moſt <hi>(for though Iſrael be as the Sea-ſand, yet a remnant only ſhall be ſaved.)</hi> By Covenant relation, or external
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57924:139"/>profeſſion only, as there are Believers only by profeſſion now under the Goſpel, by virtue of which they are eſteemed within the Covenant, and admitted to the privileges annexed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That confident aſſertion too is ſpoken without book, namely, <hi>That Circumciſion belonged to all the lineage of</hi> Abraham, <hi>good and bad.</hi> For</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Female-poſterity were not circumciſed perſonally: this he himſelf objecteth againſt us, and that right enough, for the command was only for the <hi>Males,</hi> not Females, by reaſon of their incapacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any credit may be given to the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors:</hi> (as who is ſo ſilly as to deny it them, in a matter of Fact of this nature) they tell us that the Male-children of an excomunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that remained impenitent were not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and that this was one of the ways, by which they puniſhed impenitent excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſons; <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath it out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>

                  </note> and we have the ſame atteſted in <hi>Godwin</hi>'s <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover during ſo long a time as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were in the wilderneſs, there was not one Infant of all that were born there circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and ſo they wanted the ſignal mark. We ſee in ſome caſes the Ordinance was ſuſpended, (as Chriſt allows us a diſpenſation in reſpect of the Sabbath) and we may ſay of Circumciſion, as he did of the Sabbath, Circumciſion was made for man, and not man for Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Circumciſion belonged to all the poſterity of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57924:139"/>
                  <hi>good and bad</hi> (as he ſays before) <hi>without any ſuch limitation as is put upon Baptiſm, if thou believeſt with thy heart thou mayſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> And why was that? But becauſe not only the <hi>Eunuch</hi> there, but the reſt of the adult perſons, that we read of in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who were baptzed, were the firſt Subjects of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that requires perſonal profeſſion of Faith; (was in <hi>Abraham</hi> who was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; but it was not ſo with his children) and they were all of them <hi>Aliens,</hi> (for not only the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but Jews alſo were to be look'd upon as ſuch, in reference to the new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrantion of Baptiſm) and therefore it was neceſſary they ſhould make a profeſſion of their Faith,<note place="margin">Mr. Geree. Vind. Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doboptiſt.</note> and acceptance of the Govenant-under the new adminiſtration, before they were admitted to the Seal thereof, Baptiſm: ſo if any Miniſter of the Goſpel ſhould preach to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> they are to have ſome account of their Faith, before they ought to baptize them; but upon their believing, and being baptized, the promiſe takes in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo to a participation of the ſame Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For as we have before hinted, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> believed firſt, and afterward was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, but he having a Covenant made with him and his Seed; <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before Faith. So was it with the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and their children; ſo that here lyes the fallacy, when that ſhall be taken for a rule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in the adminiſtration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, which is only ſo in ſome reſpect. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57924:140"/>to what he ſaith, <hi>of no ſuch qualification mentioned,</hi> that the <hi>Parent ſhould be a Believer to capacitate the Infant for Baptiſm.</hi> It may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to tell him, there was no need thereof, for the Apoſtles knew well enough, the Covenant in the former adminiſtration to extend to viſible Believers and their Seed: which was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But will you deny</hi> Abraham <hi>to be a believing Parent? was not he a Father to them all? what then? he was a publick common Father which reaches not the caſe in hand, neither have they any other in his ſtead, therefore the Analogy holds not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This is a poor ſhift, for that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a publick Father we all hold, according to that of the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, which he had, yet being uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of them all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though they be not circumciſed,</hi> that is, the uncircumciſed Gentiles that believe, as well as of the Jews. But why is he termed the father of Believers in both people? I ſuppoſe no better reaſon can be given than what I find in Doctor <hi>Sclater</hi> upon the fourth of <hi>Romans:</hi> namely, becauſe from him the Bleſſing of the Covenant is derived as an inheritance paſſeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Son, or becauſe in him the Covenant is made with all Believers, and their Seed. But what is this to the children of Believers, what benefit redounds to them that do not actually believe, nor profeſs the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the uſe of reaſon? the ſame Learned
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57924:140"/>Doctor gives this anſwer, although Infants have not actually the uſe of reaſon (nor can actually believe) yet to that end (as Circumciſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) Baptiſm is miniſtred to Infants, that when in time to cime, they ſhall believe to righteouſneſs, their Faith may receive confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by Baptiſm in infancy received; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Faith did againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> he reflecting upon his Circumciſion, (the ſign and Seal of Gods Covenant with him) when he went out againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> that uncircumciſed Philiſtine. To this purpoſe ſaith <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> In <hi>Abraham praeceſſit fidei juſtitia, &amp; acceſſit Circumciſio ſignaculum juſtitiae fidei, &amp;c.</hi> In ſome juſtification goes before the Seal, as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in others the Seal is before righteouſneſs—<hi>Sicut in Iſaac, qui octavo ſuoe nativitatis die circumciſus eſt, praeceſſit Signaculum juſtitiae fidei, &amp;c.</hi> As in <hi>Iſaac</hi> who was circumciſed the eighth day, the Seal preceded Faith — <hi>Ita in Baptizatis infantibus &amp;c.</hi> So in infants that are baptized — <hi>Auguſt. de Bapt. contra Donat. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Excep. 6. <hi>Becauſe Baptiſm came not in the room, place, and uſe of Circumciſion,</hi> and the reaſons he brings to prove it, are diverſe; we ſhall now examine them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>It muſt not be look'd upon to come in the room, and ſtead of it by any means:</hi> and why</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe then Males,</hi>

                  <hi>not Females would be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, we muſt now give thee notice, that we are to renew our combat with Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:57924:141"/>for this firſt reaſon is his, <hi>Examen, pag.</hi> 4. And the old Anſwers will do well euough.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reaſon why Females were excluded from an actual participation of Circumciſion was their incapacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were virtually circumciſed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> Defence of Infant Baptiſm.</note> and reputed among the circumciſed ones in that they were admitted to the Paſſeover, when the expreſs command of the Law was that no uncircumciſed parſon muſt eat of it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. And farther it appears, they were reputatively circumciſed, by that paſſage, where 'tis ſaid, the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and by that of <hi>Sampſons</hi> Parents, who were diſpleaſed that he took a wife of the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Philiſtins. <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.3. for if the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh women had not been accounted circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Males, Circumciſion could have made no difference between Wife and Wife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His next reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe all Believers out of Abrahams Family were not circumciſed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Tombes Exer p. <hi>4</hi>
                  </note> Mr <hi>Tombes Exercit. p.</hi> 4. He gives inſtances of thoſe out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family that were not circumciſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I have anſwered this before, that ſome of them lived before the ordinance of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was inſtituted, and others for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were not circumciſed, as I have ſhewn but I love not to repeat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third reaſon is, <hi>becauſe then the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed needed not to have been baptized, if they had beem already ſealed with the new Covenant Seal, but Chriſt himſelf and all his Apoſtles, &amp;c. were
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57924:141"/>circumciſed, yet nevertheleſs were baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If this deſerves an Anſwer, take this, The Covenant of Grace both under the Law and Goſpel is one and the ſame for ſubſtance, though as to the external adminiſtration thereof, there is a difference, and accordingly the Seals are different. The Landlord if he pleaſe, may break the old Seal, and ſet on a new one to the grant, he makes to his, Tenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>it comes not in its room and ſtead as to the ends and uſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Though as to ſome circumſtances, there be a difference between Circumciſion and Baptiſm in regard of their ends and uſes, yet there is no material difference, as to ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee his reaſons why Baptiſm ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not Circumciſion as to the ends and uſes: which are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe Circumciſion was a ſign of Chriſt to come in the fleſh, but Baptiſm that he was already come, Tombes exerc. pag.</hi> 4. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a very good harmony notwithſtanding that, <hi>quoad ſubſtantiam,</hi> as to the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> they both look at Chriſt, and agree in the main. The one ſignifies and ſeals the remiſſion of ſins, by and through the blood of Chriſt to be ſhed, the other through that blood already ſhed. There is an agreement in the ſignification, though not in the manner of ſignification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>Circumciſion was to be a partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall between Jew and Gentile, but Baptiſm teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the contrary.</hi> Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> again, quoting <hi>Cameron</hi> for it, <hi>Exerc. pag.</hi> 4. and then <hi>p,</hi> 6, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſeparated the Iſraelited from all
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57924:142"/>nations, but Baptiſm ſignifieth that all are one in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Though Baptiſm be no partition-wall between nation and nation, yet the end and uſe of Baptiſm is to diſtinguiſh Chriſtians from Pagans, Turks and Infidels. One of the ends of Baptiſm is to be a badge of diſtinction betwixt thoſe who are <hi>within,</hi> and thoſe who are <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Author farther tells us, <hi>Circumciſion initiated the carnal Seed into the carnal Church, and gave them right to carnal Ordinances, but Baptiſm was to give the ſpiritual Seed, an orderly entrance into the ſpiritual Church, and a right to partake of the ſpiritual Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Although I have ground to hope my Antagoniſt is a ſpiritual or godly man, yet he talks here at a carnal rate; for what thinks he of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, they were the ſpiritual Seed, as well as the carnal or fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came of him. As for his expreſſion of carnal Ordinances, it is Scripture language <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 10. And the Apoſtle means thoſe Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical outward Ceremonies, which were placed in terrene and earthly matters that reached only the fleſh, or <hi>did ſanctify only to the purifying of the fleſh.</hi> But ſure the circumciſed had right to all the other Ordinances of a ſpiritual nature as well as thoſe, and the Author is to raſh in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the—Church of God under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a carnal Church, I ſcruple not to ſay it is a carnal ſpeech of him. But 'tis obſervable, all is carnal with ſome men that doth not ſuit with
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57924:142"/>their <hi>Genius,</hi> when in the mean time the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality lieth unſeen by them in their own proud, cenſorious, ſelf-conceited, contentious ſpirits. And did indeed Circumciſion initiate into the carnal Church? (that is the Church of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Teſtament) was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the head of a carnal Church? he was the head of the Church under the Law, as much as of the Church now in the days of the Goſpel: and will any ſober man ſay, he was the head of a carnal Church? This were heterogenous indeed that a ſpiritual head ſhould be joined to a carnal Church: But I pray what ſingular virtue do theſe men ſee, and find in Baptiſm, that they ſo much advance it above Circumciſion? what is there in it of it ſelf (ſince they keep ſuch ado about it) more than in Circumciſion? It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in it ſelf as carnal as Circumciſion, and the people that ſubmit to it as carnal as others; and as carnal, and perverſe an uſe do ſome of them make of it, as the Jews did of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Some I know are more wiſe and ſober than the reſt; but too too many make an idol of their Baptiſm, they make it a fire-brand of contention, and the beginning and end of all Religion. When as to ſpeak plainly, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm of water of it ſelf (due reverence being ſtill had to all Gods Ordinances in their places) is as low and carnal a thing, as poor a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as empty a ſign and ſhadow as Circumeiſion. Baptiſm and Circumciſion as to the letter, are juſt alike as to any intrinſecal worth, the one relates to the letting out of a little blood, the other to the waſhing of the filth of the fleſh.

               <p n="1">1. Circumciſion was a Seal of the Covenant made with Believers and their Seed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Circumciſion Believers and their Seed had entrance into the Church of the Jews.</p>

               <p n="6">6. Circumciſion was a Bond to Evangelical Obedience. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. Walk before me and be upright.</p>
               <p>So is Baptiſm. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>So are Believers and their Seed by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm into particular Goſpel Churches.</p>

               <p>The water in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm repreſents the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the doing away the guilt of ſin by his blood.</p>

               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57924:145"/>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, if we will follow the Authors advice, we muſt not by any means conclude that Baptiſm comes in the room of Circumciſion, and for this reaſon which lies at the bottom, becauſe then he muſt renounce his opinion, for it will thence follow, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm is an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt. But he hath learn'd from Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to give a ponderous reaſon why (though there be ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy) we muſt not own it to come in the room and ſtead of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,<note place="margin">Tombes <hi>again</hi> Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>p. 7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz. Becauſe there is an Analogy between other things and Baptiſm; and we may on the ſame account ſay it comes in the room and ſtead of them, As the—Ark, Manna, Rock and from ſuch like Arguments drawn from Analogies, what Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rites may by our wits be introduced to the countenancing the Papiſts in their High-Prieſt-Hood, Tythes.</hi> But will he never have done with Mr. <hi>Tombes?</hi> we find this in his <hi>Exercit. pag.</hi> 7. —Where he ſaith,—By like manner of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation it will be lawful to bring in the whole burden of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, — and who ſhall put a bound to mens wits—and this manner of arguing will countenance the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for an univerſal Biſhop, becauſe there was ſuch an High-Prieſt among the Jews, &amp;c. And that Tythes are due to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> form Analogy of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exam. p.</hi> 86.</p>
               <p>Well, ſince we have this <hi>Crambe bis cocta,</hi> that is enough to turn ones ſtomach, being tainted with long ſtanding; I think Mr. <hi>Gerees</hi>

               <p>And again Baptiſm is not inſtituted or bronght in as a new Rite by us; but being appointed of God, is applied by us, by proportion to Infants. And for that of countenancing the Papiſts in their High-Prieſt-Hood: neither doth that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for this Argument proceeds, as though we ſet up Circumciſion it ſelf: whereas we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet up Circumciſion, nor Baptiſm: but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Baptiſm inſtituted of God to Infants. And therefore for you (ſaith he to <hi>Tombes</hi>) to infer the bringing in of things not in their kind men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or appointed in the New Teſtament; is an apparent <hi>non ſequitur:</hi> your inſtances being far unparallel to ours of applying an inſtituted Ordinance to children by way of proportion. I ſhall expect a good anſwer to this from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or Mr. <hi>Tombes, ad Graecas Calendas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He next applauds my Lord <hi>Brooks</hi> (who gives not them a very good character) for that ſaying of his, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Analogy which Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm now hath with Circumciſion in the Old Law, is a fine rational Argument to illuſtrate a point well proved before; but he ſomewhat doubts whether it be proof enough for that which ſome would prove by it (beſides the vaſt difference in the Ordinance) the perſons to be circumciſed are ſtated by a poſitive Law, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that it leaves no place for ſcruple, but it is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57924:146"/>far otherwiſe in Baptiſm, where all the deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons fit to be partakers, for ought I know, ſaith he, is only ſuch as believe: for this is the qualification which with exacteſt ſearch I find the Scripture requires in perſons to be babtized, and this it ſeems to require in all ſuch perſons; now how Infants can be properly ſaid to believe, I am not yet fully reſolved. This is very true which he relates of my Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> who ſpeaks not poſitively, but modeſtly, that he ſomewhat doubts, and is not fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as to the way of Argumentation from Circumciſion to Baptiſm, and withal doth yet commend it for a fine rational Argument to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate a point well proved before: that's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and more than our Author would have had him ſpoke, but I muſt acquaint the Reader with more which he ſpeaks, little to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I will not, I cannot, ſaith he, take upon me to defend that, men uſually call Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm: yet I conceive that Sect is twofold. Some of them hold free will, community of all things, deny Magiſtracy, and refuſe to baptize chilren. Theſe truly are ſuch Hereticks (or Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts) that I queſtion whether any Divine ſhould honour them ſo much as to diſpute with them. There is another ſort of them who only deny Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm to their children, till they come to years of diſcretion, and then they baptize them, but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things they agree with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Truly theſe men are much to be pitied. And I could heartily wiſh before they be ſtigmatized with that opprobrious brand of Schiſmaticks, the truth might be cleared to them. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57924:146"/>to thoſe that hold we may go no farther than Scripture [that is the expreſs word] for Doctrine and Diſcipline, it may be very eaſie to erre in this point in hand; ſince the Scripture ſeems not to have clearly determined this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but for his part, he ſaith, many things prevail with him in this point, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, for ought he could ever learn, it was the conſtant cuſtom of the pureſt and moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church to baptize <hi>Infants</hi> of believing Parents. For, ſaith he, I could never find the beginning and firſt riſe of this practiſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as tis very eaſie to track Hereſies to their firſt riſing up, and ſetting foot in the Church.</p>
               <p>Again I find all Churches (even the moſt ſtrict) have generally been of this judgment and practice: yea though there have been in all ages ſome, that much affected novelty, and had parts enough to diſcuſs and clear what they thought good to preach, yet was this ſcarce ever queſtioned by men of note, till within theſe laſt ages: and ſure the conſtant judgment of the Churches of Chriſt, is much to be honoured, and heard in all things that contradict not Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>Nor can I clear that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your children</hi>—I know ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it illegitimate, and holy, legitimate— but ſaith he, I believe the Apoſtle means that <hi>Relative Church-Holineſs,</hi> which makes a man capable of admiſſion to holy Ordinances, and to Baptiſm.</p>

                  <hi>Laſtly, the</hi> Author <hi>excepts againſt the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we uſually bring for the Baptiſm of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> Elſe our priviledge under the Goſpel, will be leſs than theirs under the Law, for theirs were circumciſed, they were taken into the Covenant with the Parent, and were ſealed, whereby they were diſtinguiſhed from the world, and this was a great priviledge, and to deny Baptiſm to children, which ſucceeds Circumciſion, is to reſtrain Gods Grace, and make us looſers by Chriſts coming.

               <p>But take heed of diſparaging the Grace of God in vouchſafing them the Seal of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, now under the Goſpel. For as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:57924:147"/>ſays in anſwer to ſuch cavilling as this. None of thoſe, City, Temple, Succeſſion of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prieſt, &amp;c. were of the ſubſtance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, for though Circumciſion was a part of their adminiſtration, yet it did belong to the fubſtance, it belonged to it, ſaith he, not as a part of it, but as a means of applying it; and though it be a priviledge to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſucceed Circumciſion, as it bound to that manner of adminiſtration; yet it is a privilege to have ſomewhat ſucceed it as a Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in as much as a Covenant with a Seal, is a greater benefit than to have a Covenant without it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He ſaith if it ſhould be granted, that Circumciſion was a Seal of the New Covenant, belonging to all the children of Iſrael, then would not the baptizing children of Believers anſwer it. Neither amount to ſo great a priviledge.</hi> And why?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There were all the Familes and Tribes of Iſrael (and all proſelyted ſtrangers) with their children without diſtinction of good and bad to be circumciſed: But here only one of a City, or two of a Tribe: for Believers are but thin ſown, and the children of unbelievers, and wicked men are to receive no ſuch benefit in the Judgment of ſo many.</hi>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57924:148"/>but ſuch wrangling will never advantage their cauſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then it is not true that all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were circumciſed, for in the caſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, if a perſon perſiſted in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency amongſt other puniſhments, this was one, his Male-children were not circumciſed. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>'s <hi>Moſes and Aaron, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Secondly, He adds another reaſon which is exceeding weak; and that is, <hi>Becauſe we are at an utter uncertainty when we have a right Subject;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57924:148"/>for if the Parent be an Hypocrite, or no elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is beyond our reach to underſtand, we cannot know whether the child be fit for Baptiſm.</hi>

We have a rule for baptizing, and that we are to follow, and a rule to know, thoſe that are baptizable, but none, for an infallible judgment of mens ſincerity, we are not called to judge of this matter, nor is it in our power, and 'tis not our ſin if we be deceived. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays well to this, in his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> how do you know, (ſaith he to him) whom you ſhould baptize? whom doth the Scripture command you to baptize? If you ſay as <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 94. that it is thoſe that make free, ſerious, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſion: I would know whether it be the profeſſion it ſelf, the bare profeſſion which God beſtoweth this privilege on? or whether it be the faith profeſſed? if it be real faith, then without that, there is no Baptiſm; if it be bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or if we may call it falſe faith, then falſe faith (or profeſſion without faith) is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of baptizing, And if it be real faith, the Baptizer cannot know that, if it be ſaid that in common eſtimation they are Believers, then common eſtimation renders one capable of Baptiſm. When theſe men have anſwered the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57924:149"/>point for themſelves, they have anſwered it for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Laſtly he ſaith, <hi>Neither can the child (when he is grown up) have any certain knowledge that ſuch a Ceremony hath paſt upon him in Infancy, he having no infallible mark thereof; whereas the circumciſed Infant had an indelible character and mark in his fleſh, to aſſure him that he had received that Rite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That they had a ſenſible mark to mind them of their. Circumciſion is true, though ſome of them had an art to make it inviſible, as <hi>Beza</hi> notes upon that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.18. Let him not gather his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,<note place="margin">We have the note in our Margent Bible.</note> which was done (as he quotes it out of <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>) when the Surgeon by art draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the skin to cover the part circumciſed. <hi>Godwin</hi> hath the ſame in his <hi>Moſes and Aaron,</hi> and puts the queſtion how it is poſſible for a man, after once he hath been marked with the ſign of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> to blot out that character, and become <hi>uncircumciſed?</hi> For thus ſome Jews, for fear of <hi>Antiochus</hi> made themſelves uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1.16. Others for ſhame, after they were gained to the Chriſtian Faith, uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed themſelves, and then tells us what is before. This by the way: But the Author ſaith, he that was circumciſed had a character or mark, to aſſure himſelf that he had received that Rite. To this I reply in the words of Mr. <hi>Brinſley.</hi> True; ſuch a <hi>ſenſible mark</hi> they had. But how did they know that that mark was given them for any ſuch religious end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57924:149"/>That they received it as a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> a <hi>Seal of the Covenant</hi> betwixt God and them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations there were (and that many) who uſed <hi>Circumciſion</hi> (even as the Turks do at this day) and I find in Mr. <hi>Godwin</hi> the ſame, in his <hi>ſixth Book of Miſcellaneous Rites.</hi> It was uſed, ſaith he, (though not as a Sacrament) by many other nations, by the inhabitants of <hi>Colchis,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> the <hi>Trogloditae</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now then how did the Iſraelites know it was given them to ſuch a religious intent? why herein they were to give credit unto the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others, <hi>viz.</hi> the Parents and other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and Mr. <hi>Godwin</hi> in the aforeſaid Book tells us from the Jewiſh Doctors, that when a little child was to be circumciſed, one who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the place of a witneſs (whom they called by the name of <hi>Baal Berith</hi> and <hi>Sandak,</hi> that is, the Maſter of the Covenant, held the child in his arms, whileſt it was circumciſed, that ſo he might bear witneſs to the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and of the name given the child at that time. Such was the uſe of the later Jews; and it ſeemeth that the practice was <hi>ancient,</hi> even as ancient as <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi>'s time. So thoſe two learned expoſitors <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> interpret that place. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.2. <hi>He took unto him faithful Witneſſes.</hi> Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to what? ſaith Mr. <hi>Brinſly;</hi> why to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of his Son, of whom he ſpeaketh in the verſe before; ſuch as might witneſs that he gave him that name in his Circumciſion, as the Lord appointed, <hi>viz. Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz.</hi> Which whether, ſaith he, it was a thing <hi>really</hi> done, or only repreſented to the Prophet in a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57924:150"/>
                  <hi>viſion,</hi> is not material: for it ſeemeth however it was a practice then in uſe in thoſe times. And from hence it is conceived that ancient cuſtom [as ancient indeed as <hi>Tertullians</hi> days] of having God-fathers, and God-mothers, (as we call them) in Baptiſm. Some perſons ſpecially appointed to witneſs the Baptiſm of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which uſe is ſtill continued amongſt us, with this injunction that they mind the child of that faith into which it was baptized, and that they take care that it be inſtructed and brought up in the knowledge of Chriſt, yet now it is in moſt places become a mere formality, and an occaſion only of feaſting. But we return to the matter, From thoſe Witneſſes or their Parents did the children of the Jews receive the Teſtimony of their <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> and they might give the more credit to it, becauſe they ſaw the ſame practiſed upon others dayly. And even ſuch a Teſtimony have children now from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or Sureties, beſides the Teſtimony of the whole congregation, and the Records that are kept thereof in a Book kept for that purpoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>SInce the Author hath thought meet to appear thus as a Witneſs againſt Infant-Baptiſm, it had been well if he had followed the good old Rule injoyned Witneſſes, that is, to ſpeak the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; and for want of which he hath given ſuch a partial and lame account hitherto. We are now come to a main point, upon which they place very much confidence, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Word <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> undertakes to prove, that the Manner and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof ought to be by Dipping or Plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Body, and not by Sprinkling or pouring Water on the Face or Head.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Paſſor</hi> the Author tells us,<note place="margin">Nec enim <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> nocere <hi>Deianira</hi> voluit, quum ei tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicam ſanguine Centauri tinctam dedit, <hi>Cic.</hi> de Nat. Deor. p. <hi>98.</hi>
                  </note> he Tranſlates the Word by <hi>Immerſion, Dipping,</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, but he hath left out Ablution, or Waſhing, which <hi>Paſſor</hi> there adds, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>After him comes <hi>Voſſius,</hi> who is moſt expreſly againſt the Author's Opinion. The Word, ſaith <hi>Voſſius,</hi> ſignifies to <hi>Waſh,</hi> and Waſhing is not only by dipping as he hints, but by pouring out of Water, or ſprinkling it on the Body, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the waſhing of the Soul, according to that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>I will Sprinkle clean Water upon you;</hi> and therefore it ſeems Baptiſm may be celebrated either way, by Dipping or Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Then for our own Country-men Mr. <hi>Leigh, Rogers, Taylor, Mede, Hammond:</hi> 'tis tedious to examine them all. We will only bring one of them to the teſt which is Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> who is <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> for profound knowledg in the Greek and Hebrew. This Man the Author glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in: Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in his Critica Sacra,</hi> tells us, <hi>its proper and native ſignification is to Dip into Water, or to plung under Water, and that the proper ſignification was ſuch a Dipping or Plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Dyers uſe for dying of Cloathes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:57924:152"/>
               <p>True Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſays this, but he ſaith more, and 'tis disingenuouſly done of the Author thus to pick out what ſerves his turn, and leave the Reader in the dark as to the reſt.

               <p>Thou ſeeeſt, Reader, how little he hath gotten by theſe Authors. I ſhall add a few more of great renown in the Church, who are oppoſite to the conceit of Baptizing to ſignify only <hi>Dipping.</hi> The firſt is <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Walfridus Strabo,</hi> (an Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writer, though ſince <hi>Auſtin</hi> many hundred years) ſaith in his <hi>26th</hi> Chapter, <hi>It is to be noted that many heretofore were Baptized,</hi> not only by Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but alſo by pouring Water on them; and that the ſame way of Baptizing may be ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. This is he whom the Author quotes to be for the Baptizing of grown Perſons only.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> (whoſe Hiſtory of the Church the Author much applauds, and that juſtly being a rare work indeed) tell us that <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> ſignifies <hi>Tinging,</hi> or <hi>Waſhing,</hi> and for this they bring <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. when the Phariſees come to the Market except they Waſh [the Word is <hi>Baptize</hi>] they eat not, and yet it was but a part, their hands only, and not the whole Body that was ſo Baptized or Waſhed. They alſo quote that place <hi>Luke,</hi> 11.38. That Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is meerly Waſhing, and not only <hi>Dipping,</hi> The Phariſees wondered at Jeſus <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that he was not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized before Dinner, that is, that he did not Waſh. Now this muſt be by all means (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome men's fancy) by Dipping and not pouring Water upon the hands; yet what more common than to Waſh ones hands this way, or by holding them under a Cock or Spout or Youre, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.11. <hi>Here is</hi> Eliſha <hi>the Son of</hi> Saphat, <hi>which poured Water on the hands of</hi> Elijah: that is, who was his Servant as 'tis noted in the Margent. It is a very poor Suppoſition that Waſhing of hands muſt only be by Dipping; what if the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees had had a mind to have Waſhed their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57924:153"/>Faces when they did their Hands, as is common; muſt that have been by Dipping? But the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Text in the <hi>Kings</hi> puts the matter beyond exception, where by good hap we have found a place, to prove that a Man may Waſh his Hands without Dipping.</p>
               <p>In a Metaphorical ſenſe the Word (Baptize) is uſed for <hi>Pouring</hi> out the Spirit. But to go on with the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> they tell us that the Baptiſm of Chriſtians was taken a <hi>judaica lotione,</hi> from the Jewiſh Cuſtom of Waſhings: which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Their ſervice ſtood in divers Waſhings.</hi> The Greek is <hi>Baptiſms.</hi> Now thoſe <hi>Baptiſms</hi> or <hi>Waſhings</hi> were not all of them <hi>Dippings;</hi> although ſome 'tis confeſt were.

               <p>The aforeſaid Author gives a ſufficient Anſwer to this, <hi>viz. John's</hi> Baptizing at <hi>Aenon,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe there was much water, is a good reaſon why he choſe that place, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to come in and be Baptized, becauſe they might go many Miles in thoſe hot Countries, and not meet with a drop of water, and it was a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57924:154"/>great priviledg to thoſe places that banked on <hi>Jordan,</hi> that they had much water, but this is no Argument to prove that <hi>John</hi> plunged all he Baptized, The Argument, ſaith Mr. <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> muſt be this, <hi>John</hi> Baptized in <hi>Aenon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was much water: ergo Baptizing is by Dipping all the whole Body. This is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and ominous way of arguing, to thoſe who deny Conſequences and Deductions for to warrant duties, without expreſs ſyllabical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept — None of our Conſequences for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm are ſo ſtrained and far-fetcht. It was neceſſary for them, that had ſo many of ſeveral parts to Baptize, to go where there may be much water, when they could get hardly a drop many miles. You may in <hi>England</hi> go twenty miles in ſome Countries, and not find a River to plunge a man's whole body under water, what would it be in <hi>Spain</hi> and other hot Countries, where Water is ſold as Wine and beere with us, how far might they go ere they could get a River to plunge themſelves in? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A third Scripture is that, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36.38. — <hi>And they went both down into the Water, both</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch, <hi>and he Baptized him, and when they came up both out of the Water. &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I ſee not how this Text can ſerve their turn, for there is nothing in it to prove that <hi>Philip</hi> plunged him over head &amp; ears; if they will prove it from any thing it muſt be from their going down into the Water, or coming up out of it; but that will not do, for I may go down into the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57924:155"/>Water, and come up again out of it, and yet not be up to my Ankles: and how can it be proved hence they went any farther, or whether <hi>Philip</hi> did not flaſh water into his Face, or caſt it over his Head, or whether he dipt only his Head, or his whole Body under water; the Scripture is ſilent as to this, and Men may conjecture what they pleaſe, but muſt not impoſe upon others. The Text faith, they both went down into the Water, but their going down into water was no part of the Baptiſm, for then they had both been Baptized: for they went both together down into the water, but it is ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him after they went down into the water. That the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was Baptized is clear, but after what manner we are yet to ſeek. We cannot from hence learn the management of this buſineſs, whether <hi>Philip</hi> took up this great corpulent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (for ſuch <hi>Eunuchs</hi> uſe to be) quite out of the water by the ſtrength of his Arms, and ſo Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped down again or no, or whether ſo much of him only as was above the water was Dipt, &amp; that of him under the water left alone. And beſides, as for this <hi>Eunuch,</hi> if his whole body were Dipt whether it were in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> altogether naked, or in his wearing cloaths, this latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived for they went preſently up in the Chariot, nor could he have any conveniency of ſhift for ſuch a purpoſe, for their meeting was accidental as to the <hi>Eunuch's</hi> part: ſo that we conclude, nothing for plunging the whole body under water can be pretended to from this Text.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:57924:155"/>
               <p>The laſt Scripture the <hi>Author</hi> mentions is tha <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Metaphorical expreſſion ſignifying partaking of Chriſt's Death by vertue of Union, but Plunging the whole body doth not hold ſimilitude neither with Chriſt's burial, nor the manner of burials in the moſt part of the World: for as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> notes, Chriſt's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and the manner of it was not by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Earth, for his Body was wrapt up in a linnen-cloth by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and laid in a Tomb or Sepulchre, hewen out of a Rock, and this was the cuſtom of the Jews, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.60. <hi>to cut out a place like a Cave,</hi> out of a Rock to lay their dead Bodies in; and beſides, Chriſt is ſaid to ſtay three days ſo buried, and ſo muſt they under the water, if they are for an exact reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to his Burial; but of this we may have occaſion to ſpeak more in our Anſwer to the <hi>6th</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>After this the Author brings divers Learned Authors, who affirm that the ancient way of Baptizing was by Dipping, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> &amp;c. And amongſt the reſt he hath a paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> who takes it out of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian viz.</hi> That <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> did in the <hi>7th</hi> Century Baptize here in <hi>England</hi> great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the River <hi>Trent,</hi> and the River <hi>Swall,</hi> where note by the way (ſaith Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed there was no uſe of Fonts.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, there could not well be any uſe of Fonts, becauſe as <hi>Bede</hi> ſays, it was <hi>in initio Eccleſiae ubi jam cito templa [non potuerunt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57924:156"/>extrui,</hi> it was before Temples were built, and therefore ſaith he, <hi>paſſim ad Flumina turba Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizata eſt,</hi> Beda <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Angl.

               <p>That (ſaith he) which they bring for Dipping, becauſe they were Baptized in the River <hi>Swall,</hi> makes againſt it. For <hi>Cambden</hi> in his Preface of <hi>Britain</hi> pag. 136. cites a certain Author who reports how in the River <hi>Swall</hi> near <hi>Richmond</hi> in <hi>York</hi>-ſhire, <hi>Auſtin</hi> in one day Baptized above ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand <hi>Saxons</hi>— Though <hi>Bede</hi> aſcribes this numerous Baptizing to <hi>Paulinus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York.</hi> Now, faith he, if ſo many were Baptized it may be well urged againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts;</hi> againſt the former, that all theſe could not be dipt in a day; and for the latter it appears that in that Age the Adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was not loaded with thoſe Superſtitious Ceremonies, as eſſential thereunto, of Croſſing, Spittle, Oyl, Cream, Salt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Author frames an Objection or two on our behalf, which he undertakes to Anſwer thus.</p>

                  <hi>That Baptiſm in a ſence is Waſhing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I no ways doubt, for you can not dip a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you waſh it: But may not Cups and Veſſels be waſhed though not dipt?

But by your leave I will lay a Rub in your way: What think you of that place <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.16. <hi>I Baptize you</hi> [with Water] if by Baptiſm had been meant Dipping, muſt it not have been ſaid I Baptize you [in Water]?</p>
               <p>Once more <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. <hi>John Baptized</hi> [with Water] is not this a very improper ſpeech if it be meant of dipping, for 'tis as much as to ſay <hi>John Dipt</hi> with Water— The ſame may be ſaid of Chriſt's coming after <hi>John,</hi> whom, he ſaith, ſhall Baptize with the Spirit; is this to be underſtood of Dipping, or is it not rather of the pouring out of the Spirit which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?</p>
               <p>If this will not ſatisfy, I ſhall offer one Text more, and that I think is beyond exception; it is concerning <hi>Nebuchadnezzar; Dan.</hi> 4.30. of whom it is ſaid he did eat graſs as the Oxen and his Body was wet with the dew of Heaven, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. So now we have found that which the Author ſaid he could never do, namely, that the word is ſimply taken for Waſhing, by pouring on Water, or Sprinkling; for if the Root ſignifies ſo, then doth the Branch alſo. And thus my Antagoniſt having ſhewn ſo much of his <hi>Acumen</hi> in the Greek, he will alſo give us a taſt of his skill in the Myſtery of Huſwifry.</p>

               <p>'Tis a commendable thing to be cleanly, and let all Maids take ſpecial notice of this <hi>item,</hi> and as they would not willingly incur the brand of Sluts, let them be mindful of this that when ever they ſet about that neceſſary work of Waſhing Diſhes to look well to their buſineſs, and let them be ſure they dip them quite under water, or they will never be clean: and I queſtion whether this will do without ſome rinſing and rubbing, for I have obſerved your cleanly Huſwifes to fetch off the filth that way, and then they will ſhine like Chryſtal, if afterward they ſcoure them with Sand.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57924:158"/>they cannot inſtance in any one Perſon that ever was ſo ſeverely dealt with as to be Plunged over Head and Ears. Nor is there any convincing Circumſtances to be collected thence, that any was ſo ſerved. And is it not ſtrange that upon ſearch of all the Sacred Regiſter, from the time that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt began his Miniſtery, to the time that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ended his, which was above ſixty years, during which time thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands were Baptized; that if Plunging over head and ears had been the way, then no error ever ſhould be committed, no faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or drowning of perſons under water, or ſome accident or another happen, to demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te that Baptizing was after that manner.

                  <p n="4">4. Let it be granted that in Scripture the word can be found to ſignify <hi>Dipping,</hi> yet for aſmuch as it is alſo in Scripture uſed ſimply for <hi>Waſhing,</hi> we are alſo to obſerve and follow another Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Rule, that where a word is of doubtful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, admitting a double ſenſe, that ſenſe is to be taken for right, which agrees beſt with the Mind of God in other places; and the general <hi>Anatogy</hi> of Faith, and Evangelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Hence then we conclude that <hi>Baptizing</hi> is not <hi>Dipping,</hi> becauſe this Practice runs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſs to a Vital Maxime of Religion, which is ſelf-preſervation, required not only in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Law, but Charactered in us by Nature: and under the Evangelical Diſpenſation, we find our Lord Jeſus ſo tender of Man's health and life, that rather than it ſhould be endangered, even the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it ſelf muſt be diſpenſed with; and the Reaſon Chriſt gives is, becauſe Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath for Man; ſo may it be ſaid Man was not made for Baptiſm, but Baptiſm Inſtituted for Man, for his good, not hurt; and therefore <hi>Dipping</hi> which we know hath not been only to the damage of ſome Mens health, but the loſs of ſome lives, is to be ſuſpected to be none of Chriſt's Ordinances. And for this Reaſon Mr <hi>Cradock</hi> (a great Independent as they call them) in his Treatiſe of <hi>Goſpel-Liberty,</hi> ſaith, the Practice is to be reſtrained by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, for the preſervation of the lives of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Let us a little dive into this <hi>Dipping-Principle,</hi> and we ſhall ſee how inconſiſtent it may in ſome caſes be to the Life of Man.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:57924:159"/>
                  <p n="1">1. We know the Command of Baptizing takes place immediatly upon Believing; for this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, every one that Believeth ought preſently to be Baptized (if he can have it) for ſo it was without delay, as appears by ſeveral Inſtances in the Acts of the Apoſtles. If then only Dipping be Baptizing, what ſhall become of them that are weak and ſickly, that have Catarrhs, Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Palſies; Theſe, if they Believe, although it be in Winter, in froſt and ſnow, muſt to the work without any delay, they muſt I ſay be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over with water: and if ſo, may not this haſten their end, which may endanger the lives of the ſoundeſt Bodies? Is this think you ſuitable to the mercy &amp; tender Bowels of Chriſt, whoſe Yoke is eaſy and Burden light? Certainly ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as this to ſome Perſons and to thoſe that live in extream cold Countries, is more unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than the burthen of the Ceremonial-Law, and more dangerous than what ever the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law requited. And what though our bodies may endure it better than theirs who live under a more ſevere Climat, yet we muſt know Chriſt's Ordinances are calculated for all Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and all are bound to ſubmit unto them. That therefore cannot be Chriſt's Ordinance, which muſt needs compel ſome to ſelf-cruelty and deſtruction. To thoſe therefore who are ſuch ſtubborn aſſerters of the Doctrine of Dipping, that of <hi>Peter</hi> may be well applyed, Why tempt ye God, to put ſuch a Yoke upon the necks of Chriſtians, not able to bear it, when nothing elſe but your miſtaken expounding of the Text hath brought it on them? what then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:57924:159"/>ſpeaks in reſpect of weak Conſtitutions, is (for ought I know) a truth, <hi>viz.</hi> The way of Dipping is good for nothing but to diſpatch Men out of the World, that are burdenſome to it, and to ranken Church-yards.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> cannot be by way of <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath Inſtituted no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to thwart and croſs the pure and chaſt Rules of the Goſpel, which prohibits all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of evil, and the unclean glances of the Eye. Can we therefore imagine that Chriſt's Baptiſm ſhould intrench ſo much upon the laws of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Chaſtity, and Modeſty; as to require Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Maids, to appear openly, in the light o the Sun, out of their wonted habit, in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and thin Garments next to nakedneſs, and in that poſture to be Plunged, in the face of the whole Congregation, before Men and Boys? for my part I cannot bring my ſelf to believe that Chriſt owneth any Practice of ſo uncomely an aſpect, and that is ſeemingly ſo ſcandalous and ignominious to the honour of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chriſt's Ordinances are calculated for the Univerſal World, for the Inhabitants of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and on that conſideration, I ſee not how Dipping can be one of them: for how can Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be ſtrictly obliged to that in all places, which cannot be practiſed but in ſome, and that too at certain times; for ſome Countries are ſo hot and dry, that People muſt travel many miles before they can find any River up to their Knees, and in other places at Winter the water is frozen up,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57924:160"/>that the Ice cannot be perforated or broken up.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I cannot think that by Baptizing we are to underſtand Dipping under water: for the prime end of Baptiſm (as the Author ſaith <hi>Chap. 4th</hi> of his <hi>firſt Part, pag.</hi> 15.) is, that the Baptized might have the Myſteries of the Goſpel repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a ſign, and preacht to his Eye in the Ordinance, which hath been Preacht to his Ear. But what of that can be ſeen or apprehended at that time when the Ordinance is celebrated? how can any one, eſpecially ſuch as are timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of the weaker Sex, be free to exerciſe their Minds or Faith upon Divine Myſteries? What can ſuch think of, but their danger, and how they ſhall eſcape being throtled or drowned? And I cannot conceive (if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this) that Chriſt hath inſtituted an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that ſhall ſo confound the ſenſes, and put tender folks into ſuch an afright and amaze for the preſent, and at ſuch a time when they had need have their minds moſt ſerene to contemplat of the glorious Myſteries repreſented in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Baptizing cannot be by Dipping, for if ſo, then the Body muſt be either naked, or cloathed: if cloated, then certainly the perſon is not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized but his Cloathes; for <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſays true, <hi>de Baptiſmo</hi> pag. 357. <hi>Baptiſmus non veſtium eſt, ſed humani corporis:</hi> Baptiſm is not that of the Cloaths, but of the body of Man: for if one be Dipt in his Cloaths, the Fleſh cannot be ſaid to be waſhed primarily, but ſecundarily, and by
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57924:160"/>conſequence, and 'tis the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is properly Baptized,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Baptiſm.</note> or Waſhed; and yet that part that is to be Baptized ought doubtleſs to be naked, that the Water may fall immediatly upon the fleſh that hath been the inſtrument and ſubject of ſinning: and therefore anciently, for above ſix-hundred years, <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſhews that (through an erroneous miſtake) Men, Women, and Infants,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Voſſius</hi> de Bapt. <hi>p. 357.</hi> Eo etiam, poſito pudore toto penitûs corpore nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabantur, adeo ut ne faſciâ quidem (qualem pictores honeſtatis cauſâ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingere ſolent) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxiſſe videantur partibus pudendis.</note> were Baptized naked, and the Chriſtians gloried in it, that for the ſake of Chriſt they could expoſe themſelves to ſhame, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til afterward they came to more light, and had regard to modeſty; which taught Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that the waſhing of one part may ſuffice, and may well enough ſignify the purifying the whole Man, as Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> as before, in a caſe of like reſemblance, <hi>John</hi> 13.10. And this is the reaſon, as Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> well obſerves, why we only pour Water on the Face, becauſe it is the principalleſt part wherein the Image of God moſt appears, and the Soul ſhines forth moſt eminently, on which all the workings of mens humors and affections leave the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt impreſſion and ſymptoms. And 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that the ſame Word in the Greek [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] ſignifies both the Face and the Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Perſon is repreſented by the Face; and thus we Baptize the Perſon when we Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57924:161"/>his Face, which we can look upon without ſhame.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Baptizing</hi> is not by <hi>Dipping,</hi> but ſome other way, for 'tis ſaid of <hi>John</hi> that he Baptized <hi>all Jeruſalem and Judea,</hi> and <hi>the Regions round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,</hi> and three-thouſand were Baptized in one day, and five thouſand another, which is hinted brawny Arms, to go through ſuch work as to Dip them all; and how all theſe could be Dipt Men and Women promiſcuouſly in their Cloaths, or how they could get Garments to render the act comely, is not eaſily to be conjecture, and therefore it is more likely Water was flaſht, or caſt upon or over them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein we have an account given of ſome pretended Miſchiefs, Abſurdities, and Contradictions chargeable upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE were once reſolved to have pretermitted this Chapter, being a <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of the Author's former Arguments againſt us, and containing nothing that is material and pertinent to the Queſtion, that hath not been already either Actually or Virtually reſolved: but had I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that reſolution, and ſaid nothing, it would have been imputed by ſome to be, by reaſon of ſome difficulties that I found therein, which made me unwilling to meddle with it. I have, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuch imaginations, encountered it with aſſurance, that the ingenious Reader will approve my Husbanding time better, than to make a large repetition of what hath been already ſaid; when in truth it is ſufficient only to point to ſuch places in my Book, where the ſame things are preſſed as we find here, and to which anſwer hath been given. Nevertheleſs I ſhall ſuperadd a few things. He begins with Miſchiefs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt</hi> Miſchief <hi>is, by altering Chriſt's Order in the Commiſſion,</hi> Matt. 28.19. <hi>wherein
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57924:162"/>Teaching, Repentance &amp; Faith; are required alwayes to precede Baptiſm, which this makes to follow after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Reply.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding what is ſaid to this in the firſt Chapter of my Book, I add, That I deny the Propoſition to be Univerſally true, that Teaching, Faith, Repentance, ought alwayes to precede Baptiſm. For Perſons to be Baptized are, either;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Original,</hi> which have no precedent title. To ſuch, Teaching, Repentance, Faith, muſt precede their Baptiſm; for ſuch having not precedent Evidences of being in Covenant, muſt put forth ſome acts of Faith &amp; Repentance of their own, that ſo they may have evidence of right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondary,</hi> and derived, <hi>viz.</hi> Infants of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Believers, and 'tis not requiſite, that Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Faith, Repentance, ſhould precede their Baptiſm. This diſtinction of <hi>Primary, Original,</hi> or <hi>Secondary</hi> and <hi>Derived</hi> Perſons in the Title to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, would anſwer moſt of the Author's Arguments for him, if he would pleaſe to conſider it. We call the Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>Original,</hi> and their Infants <hi>Secondary</hi> and <hi>Derived</hi> Perſons for diſtinction ſake: Not as if the Father were the Original of his Son's right to the Covenant or Seal; No, God's meer Grace in Chriſt, who at the firſt Inſtitution of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was pleaſed to take in both the Believer and his Seed, is the Original of both their Rights; The Seed Deriving it immediatly from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant, as well as the Father: But becauſe the Relation of that Infant to that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57924:162"/>as his Seed, is a determining Mean, bringing him within the Covenant, from which his Right proceedeth. If you ſay, How prove you this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> Perſons, and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary</hi> and <hi>Derived,</hi> out of the Word? I prove it, 1 From the Tenour of the Covenant it ſelf: <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy Seed after thee;</hi> where there is this diſtinction of perſons in the Covenant, 1 To thee, <hi>Abraham,</hi> actually believing. 2. To thy Seed after thee, brought within the Covenant, by being thy Seed, and by thy actual Believing, though they for the preſent are not actual Believers; and ſo the Seal was to be put on them in that Right even before their actual Believing. 2. So is there ground for it in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and holding out the Covenant in the ſame Tenour under the Goſpel, as is before ſhewn from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. There are the ſame two ſtates of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. You, and others, as many as ſhall be actually called. 2. The Seed of them and others, ſo actually called. 3. In the conſtant Practice according to this warrant, in the taking in of the Proſelytes: He who came in, and took hold of the Covenant, was Circumciſed on his actual taking hold of it, but then the Original-Perſons actually profeſſing, they ſtayed not for ſuch actual profeſſion in the Seed of ſuch a one, but gave them the Seal, as perſons in Covenant, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual Profeſſion. I have been the larger, becauſe this is the Key which muſt open the way to be ſatisfied in the lawfulneſs of Infant-Baptiſm; and to repel all Arguments againſt it.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:57924:163"/>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe places in the Commiſſion, <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing</hi> &amp;c. to which he ſhould have added the other, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> muſt be taken in the Latitude of <hi>Original</hi> Perſons, not of Derived, for of ſuch alone doth Chriſt ſpeak there, giving Commiſſion of the planting and firſt-gathering of Churches, for that the <hi>Whoſoever</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> muſt not be taken in a full Latitude of neceſſity, is plain from the other clauſe to which it is convertibly prefixed, <hi>viz.

               <p>Although ſome of the Fathers have ſpoken too highly of Baptiſm, and our Authors own <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact,</hi> whom he quotes <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag</hi> 82. for one of his eminent witneſſes for Believers Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſpeaks very Hyperbolically of it, as that all our Sins are drowned in Baptiſm, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were in the Red Sea; that Infidels dye in their Sins, becauſe unbaptized, for which extravagancies and others, (as that Chriſt by Baptiſm had open'd Heavens door, which was ſhut againſt us by <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin) he is cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> Cent. 10. p. 190. And likewiſe <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the Popiſh School-men, ſpeak magnificently of it: as <hi>Baptiſmo reipſa tolli peccata, ita ut non ſolum non imputetur, ſed nec ſit quod imputari poſſet ad culpam:</hi> which he intends not only of Original Sin in Infants, but Original and Actual in grown Perſons; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this error, Infant-Baptiſm, as to its war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs, receives no prejudice, no more than the Baptiſm of grown perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo acknowledged that very many Epiſcopal Divines, and others, who are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, hold that Original Sin is done away by Baptiſm, but in a way quite different from the Papiſts; for they aſſert Original Sin to be removed by Baptiſm <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> from the Work done; and that it is ſo done away as that there is an utter aboliſhment of it, ſo as not to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57924:164"/>render the Baptized perſon obnoxious to God's Wrath and Condemnation: for not only the <hi>reatus peccati Originalis,</hi> the guilt of Original Sin, but in <hi>Baptiſmate tollitur id quod veram &amp; propriam rationem peccati habet:</hi> the very eſſence or being of Sin is taken away [it is with them annihilated],<note place="margin">Concil.

On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Proteſtants aſcribe the doing away only of the guilt of Sin by the Blood of Chriſt, &amp; applyed by the Spirit in that Ordinance; but they aſſert the inherence of Original Sin in Infants after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which ſhews it ſelf early in the fruits thereof, when they are capable of acting Electively. And all that I apprehend they ſay upon the point, is, that there is a poſſibility and probability, as ſome ſay; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers go higher, to a certainty, that in elect Infants, thoſe that dye in Infancy, the Seaſon of God's doing that, which all acknowledg to be done at one time or other before death, <hi>viz.</hi> the doing away the guilt of Original Sin, is at the time of Baptiſm; and that Text <hi>Act</hi> 22.17. <hi>Ariſe and be Baptized, and waſh away thy Sins,</hi> hath a favorable aſpect upon Gods deſigning and bleſſing that Ordinance, for the ſealing of pardon in reference to grown Perſons.</p>

                  <hi>the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> And what ſayes <hi>Bunyan</hi> to this, in his Book of Differences in Judgment about Water-Baptiſm? Firſt, that in his ſimple Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their <hi>rigid,</hi> and Church-dividing, diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles are not fit for any Age and State of the Church, pag. 1. and I wiſh there were not too much truth in what he ſaith: he accuſeth them for endeavouring and perſwading him to break Communion with his Brethren, tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others that their Seeds of diviſion might take, and prevailed ſo far as to rent and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſome from them, and that the judgment of God ſo followed their deſign, that the preſons which then they prevail'd upon became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a ſtink and reproach to Religion. I find our Author falling upon this good Man, (two to one is odds) and laſhing him to the purpoſe, for his laſt Book, you have it at the end of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Baptiſm: He chargeth Mr. <hi>Bunyan</hi> with abſurdities, contradictions, traducing the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, hainous Errors and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal miſtakes; whoſe Principles, ſaith he, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ſavouring of ignorance and folly, contradicting the Wiſdom &amp; Authority of Chriſt, ridiculous man of egregious ignorance and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned: and at laſt, that he is one that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not God, and is contrary to all Men, which laſt muſt be underſtood with a limitation, (of all Men like himſelf). But why ſhould Profeſſors of Religion throw ſo much dirt in the Faces of their Brethren that diſſent from them? <hi>Tantaene animis caeleſtibus irae?</hi> Sure ſuch language be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not Chriſtians: Let it be ſuppoſed that they have truth on their ſide; this is no good way to

               <p>Two other Antipaedobaptiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> (being come off from that hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound Spirit of having Communion with none but thoſe of our own Judgment) are alſo laſht in the Authors Poſtſcript. They have <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> both declined the Truth; and their Books, which were pen'd with great Judgment, ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Authority of Scripture in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt them (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance) for declining the Truth; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident is the Author that he ſpeaks by way of Propheſy, that what they have writ ſhall not only live as a Witneſs for God, and his reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truths, but as a living Teſtimony againſt themſelves, in their unreaſonable and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous departure from the ſame (except they repent) to all generations: if theſe Man cannot appeal to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57924:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heaven touching their own integrity, ſo thundring a Sentence muſt needs trouble their Conſciences. Moreover, if I miſtake not they are divided amongſt themſelves about the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator of Baptiſm (as unwholſome word becauſe unſcriptural, Paſtors, Teachers, Miniſters we read, of but no Adminiſtrators) ſome holding none but men in Office may give Baptiſm, others that a private Man may do it, eſpecially in caſe of neceſſity; and Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> favours this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Praecurſor</hi> pag. 72. and he gives his reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe all, or moſt of the Miniſters ordained in <hi>England</hi> are againſt Baptizing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of years Sprinkled in Infancy: and there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them that ſee Infant-Baptiſm a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a neceſſity to be Baptized upon Profeſſion of Faith; there is a neceſſity that they be Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Perſons not Ordained.</p>
               <p>I like a man that will ſpeak plainly his mind: &amp; I will be as plain in opening mine; and I think I have hit upon the truth, namely that the Oppoſers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm muſt hold that unbaptized Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ☞ may Baptize, and a Church with true Ordinances may be of unbaptized perſons; or elſe they muſt diſown their new Baptiſm, and all their Ordinances, and turn Seekers: For the firſt of their Adminiſtrators muſt either Baptize himſelf, or elſe was Baptized by ſome Perſon Baptized in Infancy, that is with them, by an unhaptized Perſon. Laſtly, I want not Inſtances to ſhew how impatient they are of having their adored Opinion contradicted, and muſt prepare my ſelf for the hard Cenſures of my Antagoniſt and his Party; and had it not been for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57924:169"/>of truth, and love that I bear unto it, they ſhould have gone on till Dooms-day (though I believe God will ſhortly break the neck of their ridged Principle) before I would have diſturb'd their quiet, and expoſed my ſelf to their ill-will. It is ſufficiently obſerved and deplored by ſober Chriſtians that are unaddicted to faction, how turbulent this fort of men have alwayes been, as in forreign parts, ſo in our own Country, in the propagation of their Opinion, and how diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is to them to have any thing ſaid againſt their way. There is a ſad paſſage quoted by the Author himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 308. of his Treatiſe, out of <hi>Cloppenburg's Gangrene, viz.</hi> The Troops of Anabaptiſts that dwell in <hi>Frieſtand,</hi> although they trouble not the Commonwealth, they ſuffer not the pure Reformed Churches to be edified without daily conflicts; and what a ſtir they kept in <hi>Gemany</hi> with thoſe Godly Miniſters <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Muſculus,</hi> conteſting with them, diſturbing their Churches, you ſhall hear ſhortly in our Animadverſions upon the Authors hiſtorical part at the latter end of this diſcourſe.</p>

For even <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, as zealous as he was for Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Danaeus ex lib. 1 Auguſt <hi>de Bapt. contra</hi> Donatiſtas.</note> is expreſs upon the Caſe in his firſt Book <hi>de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts — Non damnari Baptiſmum Chriſti ab Haereticis Paſtoribus, ut nullus cenſeatur, ſed damnamus illos qui ſcientes illic accipiunt;</hi> That Baptiſm is not to be condemned for a Nullity, which hath been received from Hereticks, but ſuch are to be condemned, who knowing them to be ſuch, do yet receive it of them. <hi>Bucan</hi> ſtates the Caſe in his 16 Queſtion <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi>

               <p>It was on this account that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> kept their Children from Baptiſm; for <hi>Perin</hi> in his Hiſtory of that people tells us,<note place="margin">Paul Perin, <hi>Hiſt.

               <p>On the other hand the Rule holds true in many Caſes: <hi>Fieri quod non licet, factum valet;</hi> A

I ſhall conclude this with the Judgment of two Divines of the Congregational way: The
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57924:173"/>firſt is Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> of New-England in his Grounds and Ends of Infant-Baptiſm, where he anſwers this Objection: How can we think that Baptiſm Valid, and not Null, which is Adminiſtred by Dumb-dogs &amp;c? <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Though God delighteth not to make uſe of ſuch inſtruments, yet I dare not ſay that their Adminiſtration of the Seals, which are given not for Converſion, but <hi>Confirmation</hi> of Grace are meer <hi>Nullities,</hi> or that the Baptiſm Adminiſtred by them is to be reiterated. Take an inſtance in the Circumciſion of the 10 Tribes after <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam's</hi> Apoſtacy, and the caſting out of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.14, 15. It was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Adminiſtred by wicked <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and Men that had no regular call thereunto: when the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were caſt out of Office in the 10 Tribes, <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts came in their room, which were as ignorant and unskilful to expound the Law, as thoſe ye call Dumb-Dogs; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt put a difference betwixt the <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and ſome <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> Additions, and Corruptions: if there be a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the <hi>Eſſenee,</hi> or ſubſtance of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as for Inſtance, if Perſons be not Baptized in the Name of God the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt, but into the Name of a Creature, then ſuch Baptiſm is void and null, and the party ought to be Baptized again: But if there be a Corruption only in the External Adminiſtration
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57924:174"/>of the Ordinance, though every Chriſtian ſhould labour to avoid ſuch Corruption, and if he hath been intangled therewith, humble himſelf deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God for it; yet ſuch Baptiſm is valid for the ſubſtance of it, and ſhould not be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. At this day the Proteſtant Reformed Churches do hold it unwarrantable to <hi>Rebaptize</hi> thoſe Perſons who were Baptized in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which being adminiſtred in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt, is held for true Baptiſm, for the ſubſtance of it.</p>
               <p>The other is Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> in his <hi>Model of the Congregational way,</hi> pag. 70. Thoſe Chriſtians, ſaith he, which of late days (calling into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Truth and Lawfulneſs of their Baptiſm) have fallen upon the Practice of <hi>Rebaptizing,</hi> and taking up the Ordinance of Baptiſm <hi>de novo,</hi> are utterly void, and altogether to ſeek of <hi>a true and juſt ground from the Scripture,</hi> for their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice herein; and ſo this <hi>latter</hi> Baptiſm of theirs, will be found as <hi>unlawful,</hi> becauſe unlawfully Adminiſtred. For if the Adminiſtration of the Seals be now tyed to ordinary Officers, and thoſe to a particular Church, ſince the Apoſtles times, that give them their lawful and right Call to Adminiſter the Ordinances; then it will follow that there is no Lawful Baptiſm, but by him that is an Officer of ſome particular Church, and he that is an Officer of ſome particular Church, muſt have a Lawful Calling <hi>from the Church to which he is an Officer;</hi> for all extraordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that had their Call and Commiſſion <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Heaven</hi> are ceaſed. Now thoſe that Rebaptize cannot prove the taking up of that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57924:174"/>Ordinance again <hi>after this manner;</hi> but are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to hold that a Diſciple in Common, that by the exerciſe of his gifts doth convert a Sinner from the evil of his ways, may alſo Baptize him: [which Doctrine Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> calls a <hi>Frenzy</hi> of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> of <hi>new-England,</hi> in his Survey of Church-Diſcipline, C. <hi>2.</hi> part 3. <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> which begins to labour with the loathſomneſs of itſelf]; For if that were true what need of Chriſt's Ordaining Officers in his Church for theſe purpoſes? or why may not a Godly Woman (by her good exhortations and chaſt converſation, Converting her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) Baptize him?</p>

               <p>Firſt 'tis obſervable, that he who hath undertaken to write a Treatiſe of Baptiſm, [mark well], ſhould miſtake both the Matter and Form of it; for certainly he is out in both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt for the Matter of Baptiſm, all Divines hold it is Water, meer, pure Water without mixture. Take the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two very eminent Divines: The firſt is the Learned <hi>Zanchy,</hi> Tom. 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 404. <hi>Materia Externa Baptiſmi eſt Aqua, Interna, Sanguis &amp; Spiritus, Chriſti;</hi> The External Matter of Baptiſm is Water; the Internal, the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt: The other is <hi>Bucan,</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity in Academia <hi>Lauſanenſi:</hi> He in his Theological Inſtitutions or Common places, anſwereth ſeveral Queſtions concerning Baptiſm, &amp; this is the <hi>18th, Quae eſt Materia Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmi?</hi> What is the Matter of Baptiſm? To which he gives this anſwer; it is two-fold, <hi>Externa &amp; Interna,</hi> External and Internal; the External is, <hi>Aqua pura, munda &amp; natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis ſine diſcrimine, ſimplex, vulgaris, non prius peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Conſecrata, non mixta, non Oleum, &amp;c.</hi> That is, it is pure, clean, ſimple, common Water without mixture of Oyl, Spittle, and ſuch kind of things as the Papiſts add to it: <hi>de Baptiſmo, locus</hi> 47. <hi>p.</hi> 616. The <hi>Materia Interna,</hi> the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Matter of Baptiſm, is <hi>Sanguis &amp; Spiritus Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> the Blood &amp; Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>de Bapt. loc</hi> 47. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Form of Baptiſm they agree in this, that it is thoſe Words of Inſtitution, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi> in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place, and he brings the Words of the Apoſtle for both Matter and Form, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. <hi>That he might Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and cleanſe it by the Waſhing of Water through the Word;</hi> citing that famous ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin, Accedit verbum ad Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum &amp; fit Sacramentum;</hi> The word joyned to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment [<hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Word of Inſtitution] makes the Sacrament.

               <p>Now though this may ſuffice, yet having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be liberal; We will ſuppoſe Dipping to be of uſe in the Apoſtles days, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

               <p n="1">1. That in every Ordinance there are ſome things eſſential, which failing, the very being of the Ordinance is deſtroyed. 2. Some things requiſite becauſe enjoyned, but yet not eſſential; but only needful to the compleat and well-being of an Ordinance. 3. Some things meerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as being the determination of ſome Circumſtances (left undetermined in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it) As in the Lords Supper, the hour when, the kinds of Bread and Wine, the poſture, and number of the Partakers, either ſitting or ſtanding or the like. So in Baptiſm, whether the Perſon be Baptized by day or by night, in Rivers or Pools, or Veſſels (ſo he be able to bear it), whether the Water paſs on all his Body or ſome parts, &amp; the reſt unwaſhed. And ſo for this of Dipping, it comes under the nature of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Circumſtance, although ſome place Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly ſuch neceſſity in it. I ſay it may be accounted an indifferent Circumſtance; ſo that Baptiſm in other things right, is true Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Baptiſm, whether done by way of Sprinkling or Dipping, which is thus proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That which equally repreſents the grace ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is of indifferent uſe, but the Baptiſm either by Dipping or Sprinkling, doth equally repreſent the grace ſignified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition is clear; for in a Sacrament are but two things neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) The matter or Element. (2) The uſe for repreſentation of the Grace. The Minor, or Aſſumption is evident,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57924:176"/>by conſidering the Grace of Baptiſm, which is principally two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt our <hi>putting on of Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> to, and Communion with him, in which reſpect we are ſaid to put him on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to be Baptized into him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. into his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. that is, by Baptiſm we are Sacramentally enrighted into him and his death, and the fruits of it, in which reſpects we are in the ſame place <hi>v.</hi> 4. ſaid to be buried with him by Baptiſm into death. Now this putting on of Chriſt is as fully ſignified, by putting on of water on us, as by putting us into water. Application of Water to the Perſon, either in one way or other is a Sign of our Union to him: and ſo of our putting him on, our burying and riſing with him, and Communion with him, in all the effects of his death, which flow from the Union.</p>
               <p>But it is Objected, that Sprinkling doth not repreſent our burying with him, as Dipping doth. Anſ. It is a fancy to imagine that every Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ☞ expreſſion uſed in Scripture ſignifying our Communion with Chriſt, ſhould be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expreſſed in the Sacrament; for the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are various, <hi>putting him on, burying with him, Sprinkling with his Blood:</hi> one ſign cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Communion with him in all theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors. A partaking a Communion with Chriſt, and his death is the Sacramental Grace intended by thoſe various expreſſions, &amp; that being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as well by Sprinkling as Dipping, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that water in either way of application, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental. 2dly, Our waſhing or cleanſing from Sin by the Blood of Chriſt, this is the principal effect of Chriſt's death repreſented, and Sealed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57924:177"/>which is equally ſet out by Sprinkling as by dipping. Firſt in aſmuch as waſhing may be done by both, and indeed it is the application of Water under the formality of Waſhing, not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Dipping or Sprinkling, which is the ☜ Sacramental uſe of it; ſo that were Waſhing with Water, though neither by Dipping nor Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet it were a Sacrament as well as either: for the Sacramental conſideration in the uſe, is the Waſhing. 2.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The Major propoſition is undoubted: the Aſſumption is confirmed from Texts of Scripture, where the Word is uſed to ſignify Waſhing, by Sprinking, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.38. where is a waſhing by Blood, which could not be by Dipping, but by Aſperſion. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2.

               </argument>
               <p>THe firſt that we ſhall mention (ſaith the Author) <hi>is that Excellent Teſtimony</hi> Tertullian <hi>bore againſt it upon the firſt appearance of it in the 3d Century.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. It is acknowledged that <hi>Tertullian</hi> who was the firſt Writer of note in the Latin Church, hath divers paſſages ſeemingly againſt Infant-Baptiſm; but yet withal it muſt be conſidered, that his Teſtimony (ſuch as it is) is but the Teſtimony of one ſingle Dr. in oppoſition to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cuſtom of the Church, and even from this inſtance we may learn the great Antiquity of Infant-Baptiſm, that it hath been in uſe above 15 hundred years, as it appears upon record; for <hi>Tertullian</hi> according to <hi>Helvicus</hi> wrote his Book of Preſcriptions about the year 195. which was about 97 years after St. <hi>John's</hi> Death; and 'tis probable,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> of Infant-Baptiſm.</note> when he wrote his Book, he had arrived to the years of thirty or fourty; ſo that according to this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation he lived about ſixty or ſeventy years after St. <hi>John,</hi> and yet as early days as theſe were, Children were then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; for elſe why ſhould <hi>Tertullian</hi> be ſo earneſt in diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them not to be over-haſty in the doing it: <hi>Cunctatio utilior praecipue circa parvulos;</hi> he would have them defer the Baptizing of Infants, aſwel as thoſe of riper years; which ſhews that it was then the cuſtom of the Church to Baptize Children aſwell as grown Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 2. Whereas the Author ſaith, <hi>Tertullian lived in the 3d Century,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Irenaeus <hi>contra Haeretic.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 39.</note> this is true, but that the firſt appearance of Infant-Baptiſm was in this Age is certainly falſe; for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who lived in the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury) makes mention of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly (though they mention many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſs errors) he affirms in his Book <hi>de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57924:179"/>that it is the peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Biſhop to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,<note place="margin">Dandi Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum jus habet ſummus ſacerdos, qui eſt Epiſcopus.</note> and none muſt do it but by his leave: Presbyters and Deacons he allows to Baptize but not without his Authority, and in caſe of extremity (that is when one is like to dye, and in the want of a Miniſter) it may be lawful for a layman to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, not excepting Women provided they did it privately and not in the Church, by which paſſage it is more than probable he was for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants, rather than that they ſhould dye without it); now let any indifferent Reader judge what a precious witneſs the Author hath ſingled out to lead the Van againſt Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon why <hi>Tertullian's</hi> Teſtimony deſerves not to be ſtiled excellent, is this; becauſe his arguments are ſo poor and weak, that they will ſooner adminiſter occaſion of laughter than conviction. I acknowledg the Author hath dreſt them up very handſomly, and ſhewed ſo much artifice herein (leaving out ſomethings that are moſt groſs) that ſome (who have weak heads, and no very charitable thoughts towards the way of Infant-Baptiſm) will think <hi>Tertullian</hi> and he were of one mind, both againſt it, and that on very good grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſaith the Author out of <hi>Tertullian, The practice of Baptizing Children was built upon the miſtake of that Scripture</hi> Matt. 19.14. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not &amp;c.</hi> It is true (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) the Lord ſaith do not forbid them to come unto me: let them come when they grow elder, when they learn, when they are taught why they come <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon

What pittiful ſtuff is this? what ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon would not be aſhamed to introduce ſuch a witneſs that paraphraſeth at ſuch a rate upon this Scripture? Chriſt had a mind they ſhould come preſently as the words plainly ſhew, but <hi>Tertullian</hi> would have them ſtay longer, till they were elder. It ſeems by the Argument that this Father, and the Diſciples were much of a mind, and it muſt ariſe from ſome ſuch miſtake as this, which is ſtill retained by the <hi>Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> that Children are not capable of any good by the Ordinance, and muſt firſt be taught; and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57924:180"/>that only grown Chriſtians and Profeſſors of Faith, are fit and capable ſubjects of Chriſt's Kingdom. But what reſentment had Chriſt of the moroſe carriage of his Diſciples, the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> tells us <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>he was much diſpleaſed;</hi> the word ſignifies to have the Spirit moved with indignation againſt a baſe unworthy action; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have them know how meanly ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they might think of them, yet they had a right to the Kingdom of Heaven aſwell as grown perſons who can profeſs their Faith: For let us take the Kingdom of Heaven either for that of Glory, or for the viſible Church, it amounts to the ſame thing; for if they have a right to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, much more to the latter, for what is it to be a member of the viſible Church, but to be one that in appearance belongs to the inviſible Church,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of Infant-Baptiſm.</note> or the Kingdom of Glory; for the Church is but one, and the difference only Reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. As for the Cavils that are made againſt our improving this Text for Infant-Baptiſm, we have before refuted them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Argument which the Author ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is, becauſe they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the weight of Baptiſm will rather fear the attaining of it than the deferring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If this were a good reaſon againſt infant-Baptiſm, it lyes as full againſt infant-Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as a ſign of God's covenant, which they did not underſtand, and it may be never would. 2. Nor do I ſee how this can have any reference at all to Infants, who are void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and the Argument is aſmuch levied
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57924:180"/>againſt the Baptizing grown perſons, who upon conſideration of the weight of the Ordinance, may rather fear to attain it, than defer it; for it is well known that ancient Father was ſo ſhy of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (as I ſaid in <hi>C.</hi> 7.) that he diſſwaded young-men as were <hi>innupti</hi> unmarried, &amp; thoſe that were new<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly married &amp; young-widows, from being Baptized, until the luſt of concupiſcence was quite extinct, and then to take up the Ordinance, <hi>Riſum teneatis amici!</hi> For verily if perſons in this capacity muſt forbear Baptiſm till then, for ought that I know it will be long enough before they will meddle with it, and one would think they ſhould have leſs need of it when freed from luſtful appetite, than before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Reaſon brought out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is; becauſe we muſt not give Holy things to Dogs, and Pearls to Swine, which ſure muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of grown Perſons that were <hi>Pagans</hi> or their Children; for this is too groſs to be ſpoken of the Children of believers, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf ſpeaks more charitably in his Book <hi>de Anima Cap.</hi> 39, 40. upon thoſe words, <hi>elſe were your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unclean, but now are they Holy,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 14. from whence he thus infers, <hi>hinc enim Apoſtolus ex ſanctificato alterutro ſexum ſanctum procreari ait, tum ex ſeminis praerogativa,</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:57924:181"/>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Reaſon (which is a ſorry one too) is, Becauſe we commit not earthly or ſecular things to Children, by reaſon of their incapacity, and therefore ſhould not commit Heavenly things; Which is alſo as ſtrong an Argument againſt Gods Ordinance to Circumciſe Children, as to Baptize them: And we need not look farther than the Text before us, to confute this Argument; for 'tis ſaid (notwithſtanding their incapacity) Chriſt laid his hands upon them and bleſſed them; to denote unto us, that though Children are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of laying hold on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being laid hold on by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating Spiritual bleſſings, whereof, as impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hands, ſo Baptiſm is a ſign.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Reaſon hath reſpect to the promiſes which the Sureties made in Baptiſm in the behalf of the Infants that were Baptized; for if it ſhould ſo happen that they ſhould dye before the Infant was grown up, they ſhould then fruſtrate their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Now this ſpeaks nothing againſt Infant-Baptiſm, but only of the inconveniency of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch promiſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly the Author would have us take it for granted that the <hi>Adult</hi> were the only proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſm, becauſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith Faſting, Confeſſion, Prayer, Profeſſion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is called for from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> We have ſhewn before out of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgenſes, That though the Infants of Believers were Baptized,</hi> of which we have inſtances given by them, in ſeveral Centuries, yet they required Faſting,<note place="margin">Cent. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>417.</hi>
                  </note> Confeſſion, of Aliens <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57924:181"/>to Baptiſm; &amp; therefore having ſpoken ſo much to this before, I ſhall only add one paſſage out of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in Lib. <hi>de paſſione Imaginis Domini,</hi> where he ſpeaks concerning-ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> who proſtrated themſelves at the feet of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and deſired Baptiſm; ſo after they had been inſtructed ſeveral days in the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and had Faſted three days, they were Baptized. I ſhall add one Reaſon more of <hi>Tertullian's</hi> againſt the Baptiſm of Infants, and it is inſerted between his fourth and fifth, and therefore the Author could not be ignorant of it, but hath purpoſely omitted it, and it is this; <hi>Quid feſtinat innocens aetas ad remiſſionem peccatorum?</hi> &amp;c. Why ſhould innocent Children haſten to be Baptized, for the remiſſion of ſins? 'Twas his error (as of other of the Fathers) that Baptiſm did away the guilt of ſin; and either he owned not Original Sin, as his words ſeem to imply, or elſe he thought it more prudential to defer Baptiſm, till the Child had contracted, or heaped up more, that ſo it might be waſhed away altogether. This the Author took notice of, but was ſo ſubtle, as not to give the leaſt hint of it, for that would have quite ſpoiled his excellent Teſtimony. And beſides what we have ſaid to invalidate what is brought from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> let the Reader know that though he would have Infant-Baptiſm delayed, yet it was not becauſe he judged it unlawful, but inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as before: for even this Father himſelf allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Baptiſm rather than they ſhould dye unbaptized. And thus we ſee the Author hath made a great cry of a little Wooll.</p>

Theſe Godly men deny their Accuſations, and ſhew that their Miniſters being much abroad to ſpread the Goſpel, they kept their Children unbaptized, till they came home, becauſe they would not have them Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the Prieſts in the Popiſh faſhion. Upon this (mark it) the Slander was raiſed that they would not have Infants Baptized, which they purge themſelves of, and profeſs their judgment for Infant-Baptiſm; all which being ſo well known to the Author, (as appears by his often quoting of <hi>Perin,</hi> who treats of theſe things) it is a ſtrange boldneſs (to ſay no worſe) that he ſhould dare affirm, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> amongſt other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, that they defended and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to, to death &amp; baniſhment, and bonds, that of Baptizing Believers, in oppoſition to that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, was not the leaſt: Which he attempts to prove,

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> There are two ſorts of People that 'tis like will be impoſed upon by the flouriſhes which this Champion makes, thoſe who are Ignorant, and thoſe who are prejudiced againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: no doubt but all this will paſs for Goſpel amongſt ſuch. But I may ſay of the Author, <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta loquitur, ſed nihil dicit,</hi> or rather <hi>probat,</hi> and that what he ſays is but <hi>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> a great ſound of words, but no proof: And this I ſhall make appear in order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> for the Witneſs born in their Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, he cites <hi>Perin,</hi> and if he can find any thing in that Author to ſerve his purpoſe I am much miſtaken: I ſhall ſhortly produce the ſame Author <hi>verbis rotundis,</hi> moſt expreſly againſt him. But my Adverſary hath a notable dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to prove <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> let us now hear what he quotes out of <hi>Perin,</hi> and then judge Reader, whether it be anſwerable to what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms under this firſt Head.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all the Author tells us out of <hi>Perin, That in their ancient Confeſſion of Faith bearing date</hi> 1120, <hi>Article</hi> 13. they ſay <hi>We acknowledg no other Sacraments but Baptiſm and the Supper
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57924:183"/>of the Lord.</hi> P. Perin, 87. Reader thou haſt here every Syllable of the Article, and is not this a knocking Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſm, that they acknowledged two Sacraments, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Supper of the Lord? This is a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed, but 'tis of the Authors weakneſs to produce it.</p>
                  <p>The next is Article the 28. of an other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> God hath Ordained certain Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be joyned with the Word, as a means to unite us unto, and to make us partakers of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and that there be only Two of them: this is a Witneſs with a witneſs, here is alſO <hi>altum Silentium,</hi> a deep Silence, as to Infant-Baptiſm, not a word <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> and he that ſees any thing againſt it in this Article wears <hi>Antipaedobaptiſtical</hi> Spectacles.</p>
                  <p>And in another Ancient Confeſſion of Faith Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle 7. ſaith the Author, we have this, <hi>viz. We do believe that in the Sacrament of Baptiſm water is the viſible and external ſign, which repreſents to us that which is within, viz. Renovation of the Spirit, and mortification of our Members in Jeſus Chriſt, Perin</hi> 89. There is a Harmony between all the Proteſtant Churches in the World, and the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in this Article, we all who are for Infant-Baptiſm believe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>After this we have a paſſage out of <hi>Vigniers Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> namely, That they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly-declare to receive the Canon of the Old and New-Teſtament, to reject all Doctrines which have not their foundation in it; therefore all the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the condemn, and abominate, ſaying <hi>ſhe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57924:184"/>is a Den of Thieves, and the Apocalyptical Harlot.</hi> This is all very good, but what have we in all this againſt Infant-Baptiſm? but the Author would put their words upon the Tenter-hooks, it may be, and ſtrain them farther than their intention, and would have us think doubtleſs, that they judged infant-Baptiſm to be a Romiſh Tradition, and to have no foundation in the Word of God; and is it not ſtrang that it ſhould be a Romiſh Tradition when it was in uſe in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s days, as the Author himſelf intimates a little before: But the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> themſelves have declared their judgment otherwiſe, and ſeconded it with their Practice, as ſhall be ſhewn by and by. They were indeed againſt the Romiſh Ceremonies uſed in Baptiſm, as Exorciſm, Chryſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-Baptiſm itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Another Citation is out of an Ancient Confeſſion, Artic. 11. The words are —<hi>We eſteem for an Abomination and as Antichriſtian all Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, as a trouble and prejudice to the liberty of the Spirit. And in their Ancient Catechiſm.</hi> Perin. de Doct. de Vaud. <hi>Liv.</hi> 1.168, 169. When Humane Traditions are approved for Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, then is he Worſhipped in vain. Iſ. 19. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. <hi>Which is done when grace is attributed to the external Ceremonies and perſons enjoyned to partake of Sacraments without Faith and Truth.</hi> This alſo is inſignificant to the purpoſe for which the Author quotes it, and doth not in the leaſt touch Infant-Baptiſm. It is a good Teſtimony againſt Humane Traditions, and they tell us what they mean; which is done (ſay they) when Grace is attributed to the External Ceremonies, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57924:184"/>'tis one of the Popiſh Errors we know, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm confers grace <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> it is alſo a good Teſtimony againſt Compulſion to the Sacraments, and that wicked practice of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Indians</hi> to be Baptized, and whoever ſhall compel ignorant, and ſcandalous perſons to receive the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly we have ſomething brought out of their ancient Treatiſe concerning Antichriſt, writ 1120. And if we can find nothing there againſt our Practice, then may we ſay of this <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi>
                     <q>Promiſit montes, naſcitur ridieulus mus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words of that Treatiſe are, That Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt attributes the Regeneration of the Holy Spirit unto the dead outward work of Baptizing Children, and teacheth that thereby Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be had. And here at laſt by good hap we have the word Children named, but not a jot ſerving the Author's deſign, for they do not hereby except againſt Childrens Baptiſm, but only againſt the corrupt ends that Antichriſt hath in it; for whether it be in Children or grown Perſons, it is an Antichriſtian, or Popiſh Tenent to aſcribe Regeneration to the dead outward work of Baptiſm, and this is that before mentioned that Baptiſm confers grace <hi>ex opere operato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid any unprejudiced Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee how meanly the Author hath acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf in the beginning of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to prove the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, from their publick Confeſſions of Faith; and 'tis not unlikely we ſhall find him as defective in what follows. We have ſeen much confidence in the man, but not a grain of proof, and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57924:185"/>any mans belief ſhould be ſhaken by what he hath hitherto faid touching the Lawfulneſs of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>

                  <p>Now we muſt have to do with Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> again,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tombe's</hi> Praecurſor,</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. That <hi>Beringarius</hi> was a famous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for the Truth againſt Popiſh Errors and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions is beyond all diſpute, but ſtill 'tis queſtionable whether he was againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>the Magdeburgenſes tell us ſo, that is</hi> 4 <hi>Proteſtant Divines that drew up the Hiſtory of the Church.</hi> Here the incautelous Reader is in danger of a ſnare; for thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines accuſe him not of this, but only tell us what the Popiſh records ſpeak of him; <hi>Beringarius,</hi> ſay the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> maintained his Hereſies, which they (that is the Papiſts) ſet down to be denying Tranſubſtantiation, and Infant-Baptiſm, who being ſuch falſe accuſers may very well be excepted againſt as inſufficient evidence. We know what Calumnies they have caſt upon thoſe eminent Reformers, <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> that lived nearer our times; what errors they charge them with both Intellectual and Moral, as if they had been very Heretical in judgment, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57924:185"/>men of debaucht lives: they have their witneſſes too more than a Iury, to juſtify all their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charges, Books written by divers Authors, enough to make up a conſiderable Library: If we muſt credit them againſt one, why not againſt all? the Teſtimony is the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since this inſtance of <hi>Beringarius</hi> is taken out of <hi>Tombe</hi>'s, let us hear what anſwer Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> gave him <hi>pag.</hi> 65. of his <hi>defence of Infant-Baptiſm; It is true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> Deoduinus Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienſes <hi>took it up as a common fame,</hi> &amp; upon his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>Guitmond</hi> a Popiſh Biſhop relates it, that <hi>Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> oppoſed the Corporal preſence in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and the Baptiſm of little ones;<note place="margin">Uſher <hi>de Succeſſ.</hi> Cap. 7. Sect. 37.</note> but (ſaith Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher</hi> in his Succeſſion of the Church) <hi>in ſo many Synods beld againſt</hi> Beringa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>we never find any thing of this nature laidto his charge;</hi> and Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> farther adds, <hi>that to him it appears, that they who in thoſe days were charged to hold that Baptiſm did not</hi> parvulis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere ad ſalutem, <hi>held nothing but this, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth not confer Grace ex opere operato.</hi> And indeed, in thoſe Popiſh times to deny the greaſy Ceremony of Chriſm was ground enough, for a charge of denying Infant-Baptiſm, as you ſhall hear ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>Next we have an impertinent citation out of <hi>Clark's</hi> Martyrology, where it is ſaid, that God raiſed up <hi>Beringarius,</hi> who did boldly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preach and witneſs againſt Popiſh errors, whereupon the Goſpellers were called <hi>Beringa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> for above an hundred years after, but <hi>Clark</hi> gives no hint that any of theſe Goſpellers were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57924:186"/>againſt Infant-Baptiſm, but relates the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) (in the ſame place, and in the words following what is before quoted by the Author) <hi>They Baptized their Children, taught them the Belief, and ten Commandements, and carefully kept the Sabbath day;</hi> upon which <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> (that had been otherwiſe informed, but now ſatisfied of the truth of their faith, and practice by his commiſſioners, and Confeſſors,) ſaid (and bound it with an Oath) that they were honeſter than he, and his Catholick Subjects.</p>
                  <p>To as little purpoſe as the former is that he quotes out of Dr. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> in his Succeſſion of the Church out of <hi>Thuanus;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And well might they ſay ſo, all Proteſtants are of the ſame judgment, and in the ſame we have Dr. <hi>

                  <p>Theſe were then a terrible ſort of Fellows, if we may believe that old Superſtitious (though otherwiſe devout, and ſome think Pious) <hi>Abbot,</hi> who is commonly known by the name of St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi> And certainly if theſe <hi>Petro-bruſians</hi> were guilty in theſe things, they were even Monſters in nature.

                  <p>The other cited by the Author, is <hi>Lucas Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Cent.</hi> 12, 262.

But that I may not remain in the Author's debt, for what he quotes out of the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> I ſhall requite him with what I find in <hi>Oſiander,</hi> who tells us that the ſaid <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> doth profeſs twice in his Writings, that he would not accuſe the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> upon uncertain report, but from their own Writings; nay farther, he chargeth them that they denied the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Old-Teſtament, and all the New, except the Goſpels: <hi>Evangelium creditis, Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> Fauli <hi>cur non Suſcipitis?

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57924:188"/>I ſhall conclude this with Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi>'s words to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> upon his quoting <hi>Cluniacenſis,</hi> to the ſame end as my Antagoniſt doth. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith that Reverend Miniſter) <hi>that reads that railing Book of</hi> Petrus Cluniacenſis, <hi>will find that he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt of what he layes to their charge to be upon the report of others.</hi> Now me thinks the Author ſhould bluſh at his indiſcretion for introducing ſuch a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Calumniator for an evidence in this matter; and if he believe this <hi>Abbot</hi> ſlandred <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bruis</hi> and his followers in theſe things, I hope he will excuſe the Reader if he believe he did noleſs, when he chargeth them to be againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, &amp; that Children who dyed before they could actually believe, were damned; which is another Article <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> brings in againſt them, &amp; one as true as the other. I ſee by this that when men are engaged in a cauſe, and wedded to an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they will not refuſe the moſt ſordid and ſhameful ways to promote it. They will fall in with ſlanderous Papiſts, and take up what they ſay to defend their Opinions. Witneſs my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, and his Predeſeſſour and Tutor Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> who was checkt by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for his evil carriage in this very thing, he boldly juſtifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and tells us in his <hi>Precurſor, pag.</hi> 29. That <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> was (though a zealous Papiſt) yet thought fit by <hi>Illyricus</hi> to be reckoned among <hi>Witneſſes of truth</hi> in his Catalogue; and if ſuch as he (and eſpecially <hi>Bernard</hi>) be not taken for Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of things in their times, I know not how <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will make up their Catalogue of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> for them in all Ages: I think theſe are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57924:189"/>dangerous words, ſomewhat derogating from the honour of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p>The other eminent Perſon which is joyned in Hiſtory with <hi>Peter Bruis,</hi> is <hi>Henricus.</hi> Theſe two, as is ſaid, were the firſt and moſt famous Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> This <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> (ſaith the Author) witneſſed to this great Truth, being a Friend and <hi>Collegue</hi> of <hi>P.

                     <hi>I ſhall believe that this Doctrine of oppoſing the Baptizing of the Infants of Believers, is an</hi> Innovation <hi>no ancienter than the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>in</hi> Germany.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Author cites two <hi>Canons of Alexander the 3d,</hi> one made in the <hi>Gallican,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> againſt the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſian,</hi> or <hi>Catharian</hi> Hereſy, the latter <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing</hi> them as for other Hereſies, ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for denying Infant-Baptiſm, and for their Contempt of all the Sacraments.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57924:190"/>
                  <p>We are informed by <hi>Perin</hi> (the French Hiſtorian,) that theſe Canons were diſcharged againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> as ſoon upon the matter, as they were known by this name. For (ſaith he) in the year 1160 <hi>Peter Waldo</hi> Citizen of <hi>Lyons</hi> couragiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly oppoſed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> with divers other corruptions crept into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Vice, Luxury, Exceſs and Avarice,</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> and he was the more hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to, being held in great eſteem for his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, piety and great charity. Now the <hi>Pope</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that at <hi>Lyons,</hi> there were ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (by reaſon of <hi>Waldo's</hi> teaching) that queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Soveraign Authority over the whole Church, fearing what this might come to, being chaſed out of <hi>Lyons,</hi> they ſpread themſelves in divers companies and places; and from this <hi>Waldo,</hi> they were called <hi>Waldenſes, Perin</hi> Hiſt. Lib. 1. p. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Monks, Inquiſitors</hi> and others, (ſaith the Hiſtorian) being their Mortal Enemies, <hi>poured out Reproaches, and laid Opprobrious Imputations on them, affirming they were the Authors of all</hi> Hereſies <hi>in the World, and that they were Confederates with the ancient</hi> Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe they made profeſſion of Purity, they called them <hi>Cathares i. e. Puritans.</hi> Becauſe they denied the Bread which the Prieſt ſhewed in the <hi>Maſs</hi> to be God, they called them <hi>Arrians,</hi> as if they denied the Divinity of Chriſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they maintained that the Authority of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> depended not on the <hi>Pope, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans;</hi> and for other cauſes which they fained, they called them <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Apoſtoliques.</hi> This
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57924:191"/>Proteſtant Hiſtorian is large in theſe things, but I muſt contract, among others laid to their charge he mentioneth theſe 3 following.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That they held Community of Goods.</item>
                     <item>2. That it was unlawful to ſwear at all.</item>
                     <item>3. That they rejected the Baptiſm of Infants.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Cluniacenſis,</hi> charged them with as before.</p>
                  <p>They acquit themſelves (faith <hi>Perin</hi>) from theſe <hi>Calumnies</hi> by putting forth a Book called the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Almanack,</hi> Fol. 45. They aſſert and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Propriety of Eſtate, the Lawfulneſs of Oaths grounded on</hi> Heb. 6.6. and alledgeth <hi>'twas God's Ordinance, that the people of Iſrael ſhould ſwear by his</hi> Name. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.53.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly for Infant-Baptiſm (the matter in diſpute) <hi>Perin</hi> gives this account pag. 15. [which I deſire the Reader to obſerve it, becauſe we have ſo ancient a declaration of their faith in this particular.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That they being conſtrained for ſome hundred years to ſuffer their Children to be Baptized by the Prieſts of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>they deferred the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as long as they could, having in deteſtation thoſe</hi> Humane <hi>inventions which were added to the</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>which they held to be but pollution thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as their <hi>Paſtors</hi> were many times abroad, imployed in the ſervice of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they could not have Baptiſm Adminiſtred to their Infants by their own Miniſters. For this cauſe they kept them long from Baptiſm, which the Prieſts perceiving, charged them thereupon with this impoſture <hi>viz. That they were againſt Infant-Baptiſm. Which,</hi> ſaith Perin, <hi>not only their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57924:191"/>Adverſaries have believed,</hi> that is, the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> and from hence came all that <hi>Bedrole</hi> of <hi>Decrees, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Decretal Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> againſt them, <hi>but alſo others</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who have well approved of their Life and Faith in all other points;</hi> amongſt the number of which we muſt reckon Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of this late <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> now under examination.</p>
                  <p>This ample account, given by ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent impartial <hi>Hiſtorian;</hi> ſo many years ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was ſo troubled with diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Baptiſm, and from one of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, a man unconcerned, as to intereſt, or diſſenting parties in this controverſy, and being ſo faithful in his relations of the Faith, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that he was never (that I could hear of) queſtioned or ſuſpected, will undoubtedly be credited by all ingenious Perſons, and is ſufficient to diſmount thouſands of thoſe Canons, Edicts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Author brings.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, that I may (if poſſible) unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> who are hardly brought to believe any thing that is againſt them; I will add two other Teſtimonies, from whence we may conclude the Body of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were not againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> one of them is <hi>Luther,</hi> the other <hi>Bullinger,</hi> both of which have written ſmartly againſt <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and would never have given ſuch a large <hi>Encomium</hi> of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> had they apprehended them to be touched with the error of denying Baptiſm to the Children of Believers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſeth that he hated the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (whilſt a <hi>Monk</hi>) as deſperate men, <hi>until he knew
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57924:192"/>their piety and truth of their Belief by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Writings, whereby be perceived that thoſe good men were much wronged, and that the Pope had condemned them for Hereticks, being rather worthy of the praiſe that is due to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Bullinger</hi> that wrote a Book againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Sermons</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Revelations, That above</hi> 400 <hi>years ſince the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>have made Profeſſion of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, throughout</hi> France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bohemiah, <hi>and other Kingdoms.</hi>

                     <hi>Touching the matter of the Sacrament, it hath been coneluded by the H.

                  <p>WE underſtand that the fear of Perſecution hath made you to Diſſemble in your Faith, and that you bide it. Now we believe with the heart to Righteouſneſs, and confeſs with the mouth to Salvation. But they that fear to Confeſs Chriſt before the World, ſhall not be received of God the Father. For our God is Truth, without any diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and as he is a jealous God, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that they that zare his, ſhould joyn together under the Yoke of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> For there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſt with <hi>Belial.</hi> And if you Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Infidels in going to their Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Maſſes,</hi> you cannot but perceive their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt the Death and Paſſion of Chriſt. For when they glory in themſelves, that by the means of ſuch Sacrifice they ſatisfy God for the ſins of the Living and the Dead, what can follow, but that Jeſus Chriſt hath not ſufficiently Satisfied by the Sacrifice of his Death and Paſſion, and conſequently that Chriſt is not Jeſus <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a Saviour, and that he dyed for you in vain. If then we have Communion at this impure table, we do declare our ſelves to be One Body with the Wicked, how irkeſome ſoever it be to us. And when we ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, do we not deny Chriſt? What death ſhould we not rather chuſe? What Pain and Torment ſhould we not rather ſuffer? Nay into what Hell ought we not rather to plunge our ſelves, than to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by our <hi>preſence,</hi> that we conſent unto the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57924:194"/>of the wicked. I know that your weakneſs is great, but it is neceſſary that they that have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they are bought by the Blood of Chriſt, ſhould be more Couragious, and alwayes fear him that can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell. And what ſhall it ſuffice us to have a care of this life only? Shall that be more precious to us than that of Chriſt? And are we contented to have taſted the delights of this World only? Crowns are prepared for us, and ſhall we turn back again? And who will believe that our Faith hath been true, if it fail and faint in the heat of Perſecution? Let us therefore pray unto God to increaſe our Faith. For certainly it ſhall be better for us to dye, than to be overcome by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore Brethren we exhort you to dive into the bottom of this buſineſs; for if it be lawful to hide our faith under Antichriſt, it ſhall be likewiſe lawful to hide it under the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Turk,</hi> and with <hi>Diocleſian</hi> to adore <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> nay it had been lawful for <hi>Tobit</hi> to adore the Calf in <hi>Bethel.</hi> And what then ſhall our faith towards God be? If we honour not God as we ſhould, and our life be nothing but Hypocriſy and diſſimulation, he will ſpeue us out of his mouth, as being <hi>neither Hot nor Cold.</hi> And how do we glorify our God in the midſt of our Tribulations if we deny him? Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is not lawful for us to look back when our hand is at the Plough: neither is it lawful to give ear to our <hi>Wives</hi> enticing us to evill, nor to our Fleſh which, notwithſtanding it endureth many things in this World, yet in the Haven it ſuffereth <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57924:197"/>vilified him, called him falſe Prophet, and Wolf under ſheeps Clothing: till at laſt by his Chriſtian moderation and ſweetneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he had inſinuated himſelf ſo much into them, that <hi>ſepoſito omni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affectu pravo ipſum patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter audiebant,</hi> laying aſide all prejudice, they hearkened to his reaſonings and forſook their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; whereas ſome a little before profeſſed they would rather undergo any torment than relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the ſame, and one of them afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Miniſter of the Church.</p>
                  <p>In like manner one <hi>Thomas Munzer</hi> made a great uproar in <hi>Saxony:</hi> for firſt he pretended an extraordinary call from Heaven, and that he was raiſed up by the command of God for the puniſhment of wicked Princes, and altering of Politick Government; whereupon he ſtirred up the people to caſt off the Yoke of obedience to Civil Magiſtrates, as they had caſt off the <hi>Pope,</hi> for the one ſaith he oppreſſeth us in <hi>Civil</hi> as the other doth in <hi>Religious Rights.</hi> Thus he goes on Preaching up Liberty, and that all men were by nature free, and that all things ought to be free and common: and when he could not perſwade <hi>Luther</hi> to comply with him, nor make good his Doctrine by Argument before <hi>Luther,</hi> with whom he had frequent conference at <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> but on the contrary was rebuked by him, and earneſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed not to diſturb the peace, but ſubmit to God's Ordinance: he began to riſe up and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, crying out that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was in as much fault as the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as bad as the <hi>Pope:</hi> and that all the <hi>Goſpel</hi> he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57924:198"/>preached was a Carnal <hi>Goſpel;</hi> till at length the common People being ſtirred up by this <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and inticed with the ſeeming ſweetneſs of Liberty, began every where to imbroile themſelves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous mutinies and troops, and all reverence to Magiſtrates was contemned and caſt off. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Duke of Saxony</hi> cleared his Country of <hi>Munzer,</hi> who wandered here &amp; there through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and came at length to <hi>Mulbuyſen,</hi> a famous Town in <hi>Thuringia;</hi> there as before Preached he up the ſame Doctrine of Liberty from Oppreſſours, many addicted themſelves to him, ſome of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort having been overpreſt with Taxes, &amp; others of ſmall and beggarly eſtates, whom he made ſure to himſelf by telling them, not only the <hi>Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rirs</hi> ſhould be prey and ſpoil to them, but likewile Preached up Community of all things, according to the Example of the primitive Churches. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus gotten a party of factious Perſons fit for his turn, he became at length a <hi>Senator;</hi> whatſoever he commanded was done: his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was a law, and his direction in all thing, as he ſaid, a divine Revelation. His firſt work was to diſplace the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and to take all power into his own hand. In <hi>Zwevia</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> near 40000 Peſants took Arms upon this occaſion; who robbed a great part of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and plundered many Towns and Caſtles, <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> being their chief Captain. At length the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes, ſenſible of the danger prepare, forces ſet upon them, and kill ſome Thouſands: <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> himſelf was apprehended, and brought to the <hi>Duke of Saxony</hi> and <hi>Landgrave;</hi> being asked why he had thus abuſed the miſerable <hi>Peſants,</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57924:198"/>raiſed theſe <hi>Tumults;</hi> his anſwer was, he had done but his duty, and that ſuch Princes as hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Reformation of the Church ought to be oppoſed. The <hi>Landgrave</hi> on the contrary proved by Scripture that Governours ought to be had in honour; that all Sedition is forbidden by God, and that by the Laws of the Goſpel, no Chriſtian may take arms againſt their lawful Prince, upon any pretext whatſoever. To this when he reply'd nothing, he was firſt put upon the Rack to know what his purpoſe was, and who were his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates: afterward he was brought on the Stage, and was ſo extreamly confounded and dejected, that he was not able to give any tolerable account of his Faith; yet in general terms <hi>Confeſſed his Fault and his Error,</hi> and his Head being cut off, was carried upon a Spear through the Army.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame mode, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> carried themſelves in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> there they likewiſe troubled the famous <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> that eminent Servant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the work of the Miniſtry at <hi>Zurith.</hi> This <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was a perſon of that note, that Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his Defence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> gives this honourable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of him, and of <hi>Luther,</hi> pag. 360. <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and Hulderick Zwinglius, are moſt excellent Men, even ſent of God to give light to the whole World.</hi> This ſame <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> whilſt he was buſy in carrying on the work of Reformation, (as we are informed by <hi>Melchior Adamus</hi>) was interrupted by the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> Firſt they declaimed againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and rebaptized themſelves as before was hinted. <hi>Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57924:199"/>was very tender of them, and treated them with much gentleneſs,<note place="margin">Quod Autores &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noics erant, &amp; docts, &amp; oves, &amp; cives, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariter egit. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Adam.</hi> in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>Zwinglii</hi> p. <hi>30.</hi>

This moved <hi>Zwinglius</hi> to try his ſtrength with them, and indeed the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> firſt made a challenge on the <hi>6th November</hi> 1525 to diſpute the point with any of the Reformed Divines. Hereupon <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and some others had the patience to argue with them publickly in the Court before the <hi>Senate,</hi> three ſeveral days; and when (as <hi>Spanhemius</hi> tells us) they were by ſtrength of argument in full demonſtration of Spirit and of power, confuted, they fell to Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and poured out reproachful ſpeeches. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Adamus</hi> gives the ſame account in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his Life.<note place="margin">Habita ſunt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putationes cum ipſis ſeriae, in quibus erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum convicti, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemiis, &amp; convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis deſpumarunt in Antagoniſtas. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Adam.</hi>
                     </note> The ſaid <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ſo overpowred them with Arguments at that time, that one of them had a pretty conceit beyond the reſt, and ſaid <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, and could prove any thing, but ſaith he, O <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, I adjure thee by the living God to ſpeak thy Conſcience and tell us truth.</hi> I will <hi>ſaid he:</hi> Thou art a ſeditious Fellow, ſince milder anſwers will not ſerve the turn, I ſpeak plain and home.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57924:199"/>declared that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> had ſaid enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them; eſtabliſhed Infant-Baptiſm, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> Teachers to be ſilent and quiet.

                  <p n="2">2. In the next place the Author tells us how <hi>the Anabaptiſts ſpread themſelves about this time over all the low Countries, which is very true, both in</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia, Frieſland, Holland, <hi>to the horrour and confuſion of thoſe parts;</hi> for the light of the Goſpel which brake out but a little before in <hi>High-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> darted down its beams to the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and the bleſſed work of Reformation was carrying on apace, had not the ſame ſort of People broken in again, to diſtract the Churches then planting, and diſturb the Miniſters. Take
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57924:200"/>but one inſtance, which is <hi>inſtar-omnium:</hi> At <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> this troubleſom <hi>Sect</hi> firſt appeared, there they ſoared high, pretended Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, they inſinuated themſelves into the eſteem of men by an appearance of Sanctity at firſt, and in a ſhort time gained a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people over to them. We muſt know that at this time <hi>Popery</hi> was the prevailing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here, as in other Towns of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the people began to reliſh the ſweetneſs of the Goſpel, and Truth did every day triumph over <hi>Popiſh</hi> errors. Several <hi>Miniſters</hi> were ſent down from <hi>Magburg</hi> to propagate th <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> intereſt loſt ground a-pace, and their <hi>Doctors</hi> durſt not diſpute with the <hi>Reformed</hi> Divines from <hi>Scripture.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Senate</hi> ordained ſome of the <hi>Churches,</hi> for the uſe of the <hi>Reformed;</hi> this indeed diſpleaſed the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but it came not to <hi>Arms</hi> or <hi>Blows</hi> (as the <hi>Author</hi> falſly ſuggeſts) <hi>pag.</hi> 324 of his <hi>Tretaiſe.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> diſlike, the <hi>Senate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked not their former grant, and the work of Chriſt was hopefully carrying on, when in a few months there came privily into this City of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> certain <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in the year of our Lord 1533. of whom the principal were <hi>John Matthias</hi> a Baker of <hi>Haerlem,</hi> and <hi>John Becold</hi> a Taylor of <hi>Leyden.</hi> Theſe begin their <hi>Deformation,</hi> with a new Catechiſm, preach down Childrens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and preach up Community of Goods, and by a notable faculty of language, and ſhew of piety which they expreſſed at their firſt entrance, they ingratiated themſelves and their Tenents, with many of the people. In a ſhort time their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57924:200"/>party was greatly augmented, many flowing into them eſpecially of the poorer and baſer ſort, as thoſe that knew not how to live for debt, and ſuch as were inclined to <hi>Tumult,</hi> and diſpoſed to <hi>miſchief.</hi> Then fell they to the old work of contending with the <hi>Reformed Miniſters:</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> perceiving how much the City was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in their judgment, appointed alſo here a day for a publick diſputation, at which again it was the lot of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> to be worſted. The <hi>Senate</hi> afterward makes a <hi>Decree</hi> to clear the City of them: ſome depart for a little ſpace and re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecretly, others conceal themſelves within the <hi>Walls,</hi> and not long after aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves openly, and appeared with greater <hi>Audacity</hi> than ever; new <hi>Tumults</hi> every day aroſe, and from diſputing they came to fighting.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>New-Prophets Iohn Matthias</hi> and <hi>Iohn Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold</hi> feigned Raptures, Extaſies, and Revelations; and perceiving their own ſtrength, began to rant it to the purpoſe and to act all manner of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Rapine:</hi> They encouraged the people to fall upon the <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> and in a ſhort time the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> were burned and the <hi>Churches</hi> ſpoiled. They ordained community of Goods on pain of death, deſtroy Libraries, aboliſh Schools of Learning, and commanded, all Books except the Bible to be Sacrificed to the flames.</p>
                  <p>Then did theſe two Impoſtors ſend forth hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crys about the ſtreet, exhorting all to <hi>repent.</hi> They ſent to other Towns where any were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to them, invited them to this City as their, common Randevouz, promiſing a hundred-fold, for what-ever was loſt in this cauſe. The Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57924:201"/>mult and Conſternation was ſo dreadful, that the <hi>Senators</hi> (many of them) forſake the City, and the reſt were diſplaced: forthwith they chooſe new ones of their own Faction, run armed up and down, and chaſe out of the Town all that did not favour their <hi>Sect,</hi> without reſpect to Age or Sex; ſo as many Women with Child miſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the fright. By this time the <hi>Biſhop</hi> brings an Army, beſieged the City: <hi>Matthias</hi> makes a deſperate ſalley and was cut off, and now <hi>Iohn of Leyden</hi> aſſumes abſolute Dominion, ſits upon a <hi>Throne of State,</hi> and aſcribes to himſelf this Title, <hi>I Iohn King of Righteouſneſs over the whole World.</hi> During his Reign (which God in mercy ſhortned) he cut off whom he pleaſed, the Eſtates and Lives of men being at his devotion: he perpetrated horrible <hi>Villanies,</hi> ordained <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi> to cover his <hi>Adulteries</hi> and monſtrous <hi>Luſts,</hi> murdered divers perſons, ſtood out ſo long againſt the Beſiegers, that the <hi>Famine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed miſerably in the City, and the people periſhed in great numbers, and thoſe that eſcaped out were pitied and ſpared by the Beſiegers, being nothing but skin and bones.

                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to make ſome remarks u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what the Author acquaints us with in favour of ſome of the <hi>German-Anabaptiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is that of <hi>Caſſander</hi> who in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> ſays <hi>That the Anabaptiſts of the Belgick and lower Germany, are followers of</hi> Menno Simonis, <hi>and concerning whom he gives a good report as of a Godly man.</hi>

                     <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. p.</hi> 25. only with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Tombes</hi> quotes <hi>Caſſander's</hi> words in Latin, which the <hi>Author</hi> tranſlates, and <hi>Tombes</hi> is ſo ingenious as to acknowledg both <hi>Munzer,</hi> and thoſe at the City of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to have rebelled againſt Magiſtracy, for whom my Antagoniſt doth Apologize. But, ſaith Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> But ſince thoſe dayes it cannot be found that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> by Writings or Actions have done it.</p>
                  <p>Now to this Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> makes Reply, that he doth not hear much of their denying the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57924:202"/>Authority, nor will he take upon him to Divine what they would do, if they ſhould increaſe to much ſtrength, but prays that it may not be ſo.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Caſſander,</hi> I find indeed he ſpeaks favourably of ſome of their perſons, but doth not in the leaſt excuſe their <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Principles;</hi> and for <hi>Menno Simonis,</hi> as <hi>Spanhemins</hi> tells us, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a diſlike of their actings at <hi>Munſter,</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs acknowledged them for Brethren, though weak ones, and profeſſed that notwithſtanding their calamity, they might find <hi>God</hi> merciful unto them. This <hi>Menno</hi> indeed renounced <hi>Popery,</hi> and came over to the <hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> but withal is ſaid to embrace and preach up divers <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> concerning the <hi>Human</hi> nature of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> and other Errors about the office of the <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> and though 'tis true, (as the <hi>Author</hi> ſaith) from <hi>Menno,</hi> many <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are called <hi>Meunonites</hi> at this day, yet let him know from <hi>Spanhemius</hi> (one of their own Country, and lately publick Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Leyden</hi>) that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are not ſo bad all of them as to follow his opinions.<note place="margin">Tombe's <hi>Praeeur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> Sect. 82. p. 62.</note> To let paſs what he cites out of <hi>Cloppenburg,</hi> taken out of <hi>Tombes</hi> Praecurſor. p. 62.</p>

                     <hi>Tombes</hi> relates out of one of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, that <hi>Huebmer</hi> came to <hi>Zurich,</hi> and there made a <hi>Recantation,</hi> but it appears he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken by the <hi>Emperour</hi> and burnt at <hi>Vienna,</hi> for what cauſe I know not ſaith Mr. <hi>Tombes.</hi> Then farther he relates more of what he finds in <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his Epiſtle to <hi>Gynoraeus viz.</hi> We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove dexterity and moderation in a man; but in that man (I wiſh I were deceived ſaith <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>) I never perceived any thing in him but an immoderate thirſt after profit and glory.

                  <p>After this he tells us out of <hi>Comenius,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes that befel the Anabaptiſts upon the defeat of <hi>Frederick,</hi> by the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s forces at <hi>Prague,</hi> how <hi>that the Enemy began the year after the victory with the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>in</hi> Moravia, <hi>and baniſhed a great company of them, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I have this to ſay, that they dealt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, in compariſon of their dealings with the Godly Miniſters that were for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57924:204"/>for as ſoon as ever <hi>Fredrick Elector Palatine</hi> (the Defender of their Faith and Perſons) was defeated, the faithful Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes) were the <hi>proto-Martyrs.</hi> It was the precious blood of thoſe men that was firſt ſpilt, and the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> cruelty ſhewed it ſelf moſt barbarouſly againſt them. Divers of them were ſhot to death, excruciated, and tortured with new-invented Torments, covering ſome with hot burning coals, twiſting about the fore-head of others knotty Cords, and with a ſtick ſtraining their heads, till their eyes were ready to ſtart out; cruelly burning one with his Wife, broiling an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to death with a fire made under him; cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another in ſmall pieces; hanging another by the privy members, being 70 years old, with his Books fired under him; and at laſt ſhot through the body and ſlain: another being above 70 years old was brought into the market place, laid upon the fire and burnt to death. Thus the poor Miniſters in every place ſuffered: all baniſhed out of <hi>Prague,</hi> twenty one out of <hi>Cuttenburgh,</hi> many <hi>Citizen's</hi> accompanying them, one of which preached on that Text, <hi>They ſhall caſt you out of the Synagogue;</hi> all the multitude preſent bewailing their loſs with great lamentations. Thus did they deal with them at <hi>Boſlavia, Radecium, Zaticum,</hi> and in other places, and ſome were ſtifled and poyſoned with the ſtink of Priſons:<note place="margin">Comenius, Clarks <hi>Martyrology. pag.</hi> 183, 184.</note> ſee all this in <hi>Comenius</hi> his Hiſtory of thoſe perſecutions; which is Tranſlated, and in <hi>Clark's Martyrology</hi> taken thence.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57924:204"/>
                  <p>As for that which follows, <hi>That the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts which were baniſhed out of</hi> Moravia <hi>into the neigbouring Countries of</hi> Hungaria <hi>and</hi> Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>were of the Waldenſian ſtock,</hi> he hath nothing for it, but a Conjecture.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he adds, <hi>that theſe were of the Stock that had been inſtructed by the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>of old, becauſe of their living together in Houſes or Colledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which was the cuſtom of the</hi> Waldenſes: But foraſmuch as we have heard before, that it was their cuſtom to baptize their Children, we have better reaſon to conclude they were none of their Stock. And if that be true which the Scholar ſaith (who came from thoſe parts about 5, or 6 years ſince) that they live together after that manner in <hi>Hungaria, Tranſilvania,</hi> I wiſh them good fellowſhip and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>We have two or three impertinent Stories more, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some of the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Sect were puniſhed at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d</hi>'s time, and doth he think this was for denying Infant-Baptiſm? Nay rather it appears they were no <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> for if they had, no doubt <hi>Holinſhhead</hi> in his <hi>Cron.</hi> or Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> in his Hiſtory of the ſtate of the Church would have told us ſo. And 'tis ſtrange the Author ſhould thus impoſe his groundleſs Conjecture upon the Reader. Take the Story as it is in <hi>Holinſhhead</hi> and then judg. About the ſame time came certain Dutch-Men of the ſort called <hi>Valdoies</hi> over into this Realm, to the number of thirty or more, who held Opinions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, contrary to the Faith of the Roman-Church: Thoſe which at that time came were indifferently
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57924:205"/>well learned, and their principal or Ring-leader was named <hi>Gerard.</hi> Now alſo was a Council aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whereat the Dogmatiſts were examined upon certain points of their Profeſſion. The aforeſaid <hi>Gerard</hi> undertaking to anſwer for them all, proteſted that they were good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and had the Doctrine of the Apoſtles in all reverence. Moreover, being examined what they thought of the Subſtance of the Godhead, and the merits of Chriſt, they anſwered rightly, and to the point. But being farther examined upon other Articles of Religion then received, they ſwerved from the Church, and namely in the uſe of the Divine Sacraments, derogating ſuch grace from the ſame, as the Church by her Authority had then aſcribed to them; and what was that think you? but this that they did not confer grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> from the work done; for this Romiſh Tenent, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> ever oppoſed, as before in their Confeſſions, and can any Man ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally pick any thing out of this Story againſt Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Next we have a Relation of ſeven Dutch Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts indeed, that came over with <hi>Anne</hi> a <hi>Cleve</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s time 1528. near about two years after <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> ſent out his 12 Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to propagate their Opinions over all the World, and the King might well judg theſe to be ſome ſuch that might occaſion diſturbance in this Nation likewiſe; ſo that this inſtance will appear to ſignify nothing, for <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> burnt more Paedobaptiſts than Anabaptiſts. And that theſe were not put to death purely on the account of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57924:205"/>Anabaptiſtry is beyond all doubt, but as Hereticks for diſowning the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation &amp;c. or why might it not be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on the ſame ſcore, for which thoſe ſuffered in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time? For in her time alſo, ſaith he, in the year 1575. a Congregation of Anabaptiſts were taken at the Meeting within Ald-gate, 27 of whom were impriſoned, and of them four recanted, two were burned and the reſt baniſhed; and he quotes <hi>Stow's</hi> Cron. for it, but very darkly and partially: for he neither tells us out of him (as he ought to have done) what Anabaptiſts they were, nor what they held, nor for what they were burnt, as <hi>Stow,</hi> and alſo <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſhead</hi> doth in their Cronicles, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they were <hi>Dutch</hi> Anabaptiſts (coming hither not long after the <hi>German</hi> Commotions).</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they held Vile, Blaſphemous, and dangerous Opinions againſt Chriſt, and the peace and welfare of the State, for which they were thought worthy of Death. I ſhall give it to you in the Words of <hi>Stow,</hi> and <hi>Holing ſhead,</hi> which is thus in both <hi>verbatim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time Anno Domini 1574, on Eaſter day, which was the third of April, about nine of the Clock in the fore-noon, was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Congregation of Anabaptiſts <hi>Dutch-Men,</hi> in a houſe without the Bar of Aldgate Priſon; and four of them bearing faggots recanted as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>I. I. T. R. H.</hi> being ſeduced by the Devil, the ſpirit of Error, and falſe Teachers, his Miniſters, have fallen into certain moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and dangerous Errors; namely:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57924:206"/>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That Chriſt took not Fleſh of the Subſtance of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That Infants of the Faithful ought not to be Baptized.</item>
                        <item>3. That a Chriſtian may not be a Magiſtrate, or bear the Sword or Office of Authority.</item>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by the Grace of God, and through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with good and learned Miniſters of Chriſt his Church, I underſtand and acknowledg the ſame to be moſt damnable and deteſtable Hereſies, and do ask God and his Church Mercy for my ſaid former Errors, and do forſake and renounce them. Now let any man judg whether theſe be not fine fellows to be brought in for a Teſtimony againſt Infant-Baptiſm, &amp; whether the Author hath done well in endeavouring to reflect diſhonour upon the Reign of that Famous <hi>Queen,</hi> as if they had been burnt meerly for not owning Infant-Baptiſm: To tell ſuch blind Stories is not for the honour of his cauſe; but 'tis his humour and he cannot leave it. And now at length we are come to the dregs of his Treatiſe, and there indeed he ſeems very culpable in his <hi>Eſſay</hi> to Palliate thoſe foul and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous Crimes, which were perpetrated by the Anabaptiſts of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is ſuch a piece of weakneſs as will expoſe him to the juſt Cenſure, not only of all judicious Perſons beſides, but even of his own party. Even Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowled geth the actions of <hi>Muncer,</hi> and what was done at the City of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and when Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> had ſpoken of the World of miſchief that people did, and what dangerous Hereſies
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57924:206"/>&amp; Blaſphemies they held, Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſeth; That much of this is true, I make no queſtion, <hi>Examen</hi> p. 24. Then again in his <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſor</hi> p. 29. he complains (and that upon good ground) of the abuſe of charging thoſe Tenents, and practices upon all of the ſame Profeſſion, which is true of ſome, as that all Anabaptiſts are wicked becauſe thoſe of <hi>Munſter</hi> were ſo. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> is ſo knowing a Man, and ſo wiſe, that he durſt not queſtion the verity of thoſe things, and that becauſe, as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> ſays, the things have been done ſo lately, and ſo many agreeing Stories are written of them, and by Men of ſuch undoubted faith and honeſty, that it leaves no place for doubting. And, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith on the ſame occaſion, if the Teſtimony of theſe holy and precious Men whoſe ſervice the Lord ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly made uſe of in the Reformation of thoſe Countries from Popiſh darkneſs, as <hi>Luther, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton, Zwinglius, Bullinger</hi> and others, that did, and ſuffered ſo much to accompliſh it, and lived in the Country and times where, and when theſe things were acted, may not be credited, then we may call in queſtion the truth of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory whatſoever. Add hereunto the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe famous Men, <hi>Peter Martyr, Calvin, Beza, Bucer;</hi> who can ſcarce ſpeak of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-Anabaptiſts with patience, or give them any other title (what-ever the charitable Author ſays) than Furies, Blaſphemous, Unclean, Seditious, Frant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus far the Author ſpeaks well, for it is not fair dealing to judg at ſuch a rate, and Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> before him argues rightly in the caſe, in his <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſor</hi> p. 56. I am ſure, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> it is no Rule to judg a Doctrine falſe by this that the Profeſſors miſcarry, but only to make Men wary and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; if it be, we muſt judg the ſame Doctrine falſe by reaſon of ſome mens miſcarriages; and true becauſe of others godly living. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we may ſafely affirm that Doctrine is to be ſuſpected falſe, which is uſually attended with groſs miſcarriages in the Profeſſors of it, for that ſpeaks the Doctrine Ominous, and looks like a Spiritual Judgment of God upon it. And I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh there were no ground to ſay, that of ſuch a nature is the Doctrine of Baptizing grown Perſons in oppoſition to that of the Infant-Seed of Believers. For not to inſiſt upon the horrid
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57924:207"/>Errors and wicked Lives of thoſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> nor of the Blaſphemies and Immoralities of divers Perſons here in our own Nation; the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple it ſelf of Anabaptiſtry is of a dangerous nature, which, in that rigidity as ſome men hold it, is of ſuch a diſquieting tendency, that as Mr. <hi>Bunyan</hi> ſpeaks before, it is not fit for any Age or State of the Church. I cannot but ſigh to conſider the ways of ſome men, whoſe Spirits are impregnated there-with, ſo that their very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution inclines them to nothing more than to rent, and tear, and divide the Church: The Zeal for their Opinion hath and doth ſtill prove the greateſt hinderance to the conjunction of Chriſtians here in this Nation. For as ſoon as they become Baptiſts as ſome call them (and our oppoſites love to appropriate the name to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they fall off from Godly Miniſters, and People differing from them, though never ſo Holy. But let Men calmly conſider whether this be not an effect of ignorance and pride, and more from an erring, than well inſtructed Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and what a ſcandal and ſhame it is to the Chriſtian Religion to make it thus a fomenter of faction and diſturbance in the World; and what an injury is hereby done to Chriſt by contracting, and narrowing his Intereſt in ſuch a manner. But I ſee not how it can be otherwiſe, if men adhere and ſtrictly keep themſelves to the Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtical Principle; for if our Miniſters be no true Miniſters, and our Baptiſm a Nullity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently our Churches no true Churches, how can they hold Communion with us? &amp; though ſome that are for the Baptiſm of Believers only,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57924:208"/>do, yet it muſt be imputed to their good nature, and not their Principle, which they croſs in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Farther, ſaith he, <hi>if it be granted many Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts did prove ſo horribly wicked in</hi> Germany, <hi>yet others that owned that Principle, were Men of another Spirit, both in that as well as in former times, for which we have moſt ample and authentick Teſtimonie from their greateſt enemies. Witneſs that honourable Character that</hi> Raynerius, <hi>the bloody Inquiſitor gives of them in thoſe days in</hi> France, Caſſander, Bellarmine, <hi>and</hi> Baronius <hi>of thoſe in</hi> Germany, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>of them in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

And what though <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſaith, in two of them, namely <hi>Menno Simonis</hi> and <hi>Theodoricus</hi> there were tokens of a Godly mind; yet <hi>Spanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> [whom I ſhall rather credit than that <hi>Papiſt</hi>] tells us (and that out of his own Confeſſion of Faith) that he held Blaſphemous Tenents againſt Chriſt, and opinions deſtructive to Magiſtracy; and therefore ſaith Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> (when he brought this Teſtimony of <hi>Menno</hi> out of <hi>Caſſander</hi>) this Menno, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> (whom you plead for by <hi>Caſſander's</hi> Pen) his whole Doctrine is as full of blaſphemy about our Saviour's taking Fleſh of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and other Heretical, and abominable ſtuffe as the reſt of his fellows, though I think his ſpirit was not ſo ſeditious as many of theirs; and what Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſaith of <hi>Menno</hi> is not much to his commendation, it is in his <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> p. 25. And from thence the Author fetcheth the honourable Character (ſuch as it is); yet herein Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſhews moſt ingenuity, in that he ſpeaks out all that <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſaith in this Epiſtle to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57924:209"/>the <hi>Duke of Gulick</hi> and <hi>Cleve; Hujus quem dixi</hi> Mennonis <hi>cui nunc hic</hi> Theodoricus <hi>ſucceſſit, &amp;c.</hi> They were, <hi>ſaith he, imperito quodam Zelo inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati,</hi> moved by an ignorant Zeal to do what they did, having a fancy that they muſt deſtroy the wicked, <hi>per vim externam,</hi> by force of Arms, and this in order to the ſetting up the Kingdom of Chriſt [juſt of the ſame ſtrain with thoſe they called <hi>5th</hi> Monarchy-Men that put all <hi>London</hi> into ſuch a fright ſome years ſince]: and this Satanical deluſion put them on upon ſuch Exorbitancies. But who-ever hath a mind to underſtand fully, what kind of men the <hi>German</hi> Anabaptiſts were,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Baxter's</hi> Plain-proof. p. <hi>143.</hi>
                     </note> let them read Mr. <hi>Bullinger's</hi> Dialogue againſt the Anabaptiſts; he lived in thoſe times when, and near the place where they played their pranks, and gives a large account of their abominable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, treachery, ſedition, &amp;c. But ſome, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> may object, many things are charged upon them falſly, and fame addeth ſome-what. To which he replies, that whatſoever he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be all proved by ſigned Letters, and by certain Teſtimonies; and tells us that in judgment he hath ſilenced many of their crimes, and ſpoke leſs than they have committed, for ſaith he, they far exceed the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> in wickedneſs. And then comes home to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's plea, <hi>viz.</hi> They were not all thus defiled, and if a few among them are ſuch, what is that to the Godly? To which Learned and Holy <hi>Bullinger</hi> gives this anſwer, I have long ago known this kind of Men, and am not ignorant
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57924:210"/>how much by guile, and deceit, Hypocriſie can do; and it is true, that the wickedneſs of a few ſhould be no diſparagement of the innocent, <hi>but you cannot ſhew me one man of them, who is not blemiſhed with ſome of the foreſaid wickedneſſes;</hi> I mean Lying, Treachery, Perjury, Diſobedience, Sedition, Filthineſs.</p>
                  <p>There is one more whom the Author hath found out that gives an honourable Character of the Anabaptiſts: And they requite him well for it, do they not? <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one of their ſevereſt enemies in theſe Nations, yet hath done himſelf and his Oppoſites that Right, as to witneſs to the innocency of their Converſation,</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Principle of Love. p. 7. <hi>viz</hi> That <hi>Anabaptiſts are Godly Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But what Anabaptiſts doth he ſpeak of? Not thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> but <hi>England,</hi> and not all here neither. I know, ſaith he, as good and ſober Men of that mind, as of theirs that are moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. And God forbid that he, or I or any one, ſhould be ſo uncharitable as to think there are no Godly Anabaptiſts; but that the number of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſober Men of their mind is ſmall, is the judgment of ſome Godly, Sober, and obſerving Chriſtians. Some good and ſober Men Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, but the generality of them were bad enough, for ſo we are to underſtand him in his Plain-Proof, <hi>p.</hi> 143. <hi>I have had,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>too much opportunity to know very many of theſe called</hi> Anabaptiſts, <hi>and to be familiar with them, and having firſt Examined my Heart, leſt I ſhould wrong them, out of any diſaffection, through differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of judgment, as I clearly diſcover, that I bear
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57924:210"/>no ill will to any one man of them nor ever did, nor find any paſſion, but compaſſion moving me to ſay what I do; ſo do I impartially and truly affirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moſt of them that I have converſed with, that I have known few of them,</hi> [ſpeaking firſt of their Miniſters] <hi>ſo much as labour after the winning of Souls from Sin to God, and bringing them into love with Chriſt, and Holineſs, and Heaven. But the main ſcope of their endeavours in publick and private is to propagate their Opinions, and if they do preach any plain wholſom Doctrine, it is uſually but ſubſervient to their great deſign.</hi>

                     <hi>He chargeth them farther to be the greateſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the Work of God in converting Souls, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to alienate the hearts of the People from Godly and painful Miniſters, making it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſgrace them, &amp;c. Moreover, that in his own experience he never knew the labours of any zealous Anabaptiſt that ever God bleſſed to the true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many Souls: But many they made meer talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Cenſorious Opinionatiſts, and uſually three leave them-yea I deſire,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>any ſober Chriſtian but to look impartially through all the Land, and tell me where ever any ſuch Teachers lived, but the place in general was much the worſe for them; where the Goſpel before proſpered, and Chriſtians ſpent their time and conference in the edifying of each others Souls, and in Heavenly duties, and mutual aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and living together in unity and love, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the great Command of Chriſt, they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily turn all this to vain janglings, and empty, windy, unprofitable diſputes: So much for the Teachers.</hi> Then after this he ſhews, <hi>Anabaptiſtry hath been the ordinary inlet to the moſt horrid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57924:211"/>&amp; that few came to the moſt monſtrous Doctrines but it was by this door, and how negligent many of them are of Family-duties, the Lords-day, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The Author tells us <hi>Perſons of all ſorts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned themſelves in it.</hi> Like enough, for ſo it is uſual in all popular commotinos, perſons of all ſorts, and intereſts, joyn in.

It was that impoſtor, who was their General, that ſet out his Declaration that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to reſtore Liberty, and to deliver Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the Youke and Tyranny of Princes, which was as much to be caſt off, as the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the actings of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the <hi>Switzers</hi> and the <hi>Cantons</hi> were more juſtifiable than theirs, and not ſo barabarous, nor their Tenents ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as theirs: Notwithſtanding the reflections of the Papiſts, and ſome others of late, who have in print branded our firſt Reformations for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and they are Men too that would be thought obedient Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of great names: but yet one that hath but half an Eye, may eaſily ſee that theſe <hi>Theologaſters,</hi> either wanted diſcretion, or affection to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt; and 'tis pitty the <hi>Virga Cenſoria</hi> is not taken from them, and they turned out of their office, as the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed to ſerve the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> when they abuſed it.

                  <p n="4">4. The Author ſpeaks not right concerning the Commotion at <hi>Munſter,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>Spanhemius acquaints us, that the firſt ſtir in the City was about the Proteſtant Reformation, the Synod (he means Senate) ſiding with Mr.</hi> Rotman <hi>and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Miniſters againſt the Papiſts and the</hi> Biſhop <hi>that oppoſed them to Arms.</hi> For though the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would not obey the command of the Biſhop, (who was then at a diſtance from the City) in taking away ſome of the Churches, which a little before they had granted for the uſe of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Divines, yet this difference was ſoon compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and it never came to Arms or Blows, <hi>Spanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> tells us.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the things are written either by malicious Papiſts their mortal enemies, or elſe by ſome of their moſt inveterate enemies the Proteſtants, who were willing to take up and improve ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to blaſt not only the whole party of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, but their Principle alſo.</hi>

                  <p>I dare ſay that here are in the latter part of this Sentence, ſo far forth as it relates to Proteſtants many untruths, and may ſigh over it, that old ſaying, <hi>Quot dicta, tot maledicta.</hi> Alas to ſee whither affection to a cauſe will carry Men!</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57924:212"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, the Proteſtants were not inveterate Enemies to the Anabaptiſts, but very loving Friends to ſome of the chiefeſt of them, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after they took up the Opinion, until the Rebellion of <hi>Muncer,</hi> and that at <hi>Munſter.</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Friendly and Brotherly conference that was between <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Muncer</hi> at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> where they had often Conference, and <hi>Luther</hi> intreated him to be quiet, and not broach ſuch Doctrines as were againſt Magiſtracy and Civil Government. <hi>Zwinglius</hi> dealt tenderly and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thoſe that fell off from his Church, for they were his intimate Friends, <hi>Muſculus</hi> viſited them in Priſon, relieves them, and was their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and perſwaded the Magiſtrate to be kind, and to uſe no ſeverity; for that was not the way to reduce Men from their errors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Bullinger</hi> (of whom we have before ſpoken) begins his Book with a Lamentation at God's Judgments on Chriſtians, for their not profiting by the Word; for which God gives them up to deluſions and to a reprobate Senſe: he profeſſeth that before he did in ſilence conceal their Crimes, and ſpoke leſs than they committed. <hi>Luther,</hi> hearing of their vile pranks at <hi>Munſter,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated (and ſo were divers other Miniſters for the honour of the Reformed Religion which did ſo much ſuffer by thoſe Exorbitancies) to put forth a Teſtimony in print againſt them; in which he ſaith, It was plain that <hi>Munſter</hi> was become the habitation of <hi>Devils;</hi> for ſo the Juſtice of God had puniſhed the Sins of <hi>Germany,</hi> and eſpecially the looſe and prophane life of thoſe that profeſſed the Goſpel; but in this Tragedy of <hi>Munſter</hi> the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57924:213"/>marvelous Mercy of God evidently appeared, that e had not permitted that old ſubtil Serpent and cunning Satan, to contrive and govern that buſineſs, but only had given way to ſome Silly Blockiſh Devil, who ſeemed not well skill'd in Villany, to be their Guide and Conducter; and that though the State was diſturbed by it, yet he conceived the Church on that account would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leſs prejudice by it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Spanhemius,</hi> in his Hiſtory of their Actings, ſaith, That the Proteſtant Miniſters were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled at what happened, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts vilified the Goſpel by reaſon of it; for the Popiſh party ſaid this was the fruits of revolting from them; and they were afraid the Magiſtrate would have an evil eye upon them, and ſuſpect that the liberty which they granted, might tend to the ſowing of Sedition, if they did not declare againſt them, and preach down the Doctrine, and Practices of thoſe Anabaptiſts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, What other thoughts can we have then of that uncharitable paſſage, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were willing to take up and improve ſuch reports, to balſt not only the party of Anabaptiſts, but their Principle,</hi> but that it is the Ebullition of a Malicious, or at beſt Prejudicial Spirit? and yet for all that if ſuch tumultuous and rebellious carriages proceed from the diſtempered brains of ſome Men, I ſee not why they ſhould be imputed to thoſe amongſt us who are of a better temper. But if from their Opinions and the very Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their Sect, as we have cauſe to judg much of it doth, it will be ſomething difficult to make it out how it may not be chargeable upon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57924:213"/>all. But I think our Antagoniſt is the only Man that ever Apologized for thoſe <hi>Germans:</hi> But well-fare a ſure friend in a corner! it ſeems he loves them ſo well that he would fain ſave their credit, though by laying an imputation of forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the moſt faithful Hiſtorians and grave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſince the Reformation. Yet theſe Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot be ſo put off; for they are punctual, name Perſons, Time Place, Opinions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and Puniſhment, all matters of Fact open to the World: But if all who bear witneſs againſt an evil-doer muſt be held as Enemies, and their Teſtimonie be rejected under that Plea; and nothing believed but what themſelves are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acknowledge upon record, who will be guilty?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His other Plea is as follows: <hi>Another thing there was,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by which people in all Ages took occaſion to miſrepreſent this People at</hi> Munſter, <hi>That they were for Community of Goods, caſting their Eſtates into one common Stock, and was the ſame thing that</hi> Oſiander <hi>tells us</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer <hi>did in</hi> Mulhuſian <hi>in</hi> Thuringia 1524. <hi>And which the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>did reſpecting the Example,</hi> Act. 4.34.</p>
                  <p>O fearful! And did not <hi>John Matthias</hi> their chief Prophet (as they called him) take an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courſe to effect it, by ſetting forth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be read through the City, requIring all Perſons upon pain of Death to bring forth their Glod and Silver, Silver, and all their Goods, unto a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place appointed for that purpoſe; the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which <hi>Edict</hi> ſo aſtoniſhed the People that they were fain to obey it.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:57924:214"/>
                  <p>The other Objection which the Author at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to Anſwer, is that of the <hi>Waldenſian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in favour of Infant-Baptiſm. The firſt is that of</hi> Laodiſlaus <hi>King of</hi> Bohemia 1508. <hi>preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> Ferdinand 1535. <hi>Which Confeſſion he looks on as ſignifying nothing to the point, becauſe they were a mixt People, ſome for, and ſome againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, and diſowned the name of</hi> the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes. This indeed is ſomething to invalidate the Authority of that Confeſſion, to which I can ſay nothing, having not had the opportunity to ſee it. However if it be ſo, as he ſaith, then we underſtand that thoſe of them that were aginſt Infant-Baptiſm were not <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> no more than they who were for it.</p>

                     <hi>The other,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is a paſſage in the Spiritual Almanack, owning the Baptiſm of Children, which he conceives was written by</hi> George Morel, 1530. <hi>one of the Miniſters ſent by the</hi> Waldenſes <hi>of</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence <hi>to</hi> Oecolampadius, Bucer, <hi>and</hi> Capito, <hi>at a time when they were in a declining condition, and for ſelf-preſervation were ready to comply with the</hi> Maſs.</p>
                  <p>I muſt take the freedom to tell the Author that he doth prevaricate again, and is more than ordinarily at a loſs how to come off hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly in this thing: For;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He cannot deny the Confeſſion; that's ſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us: you have the Confeſſion taken from <hi>Perin</hi> the <hi>French</hi>-Hiſtorian, in <hi>pag.</hi> 62. of the 2d <hi>Part</hi> of our Anſwer, to which I refer you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſuppoſeth it was put forth by <hi>G. Morel</hi> about the year 1530. and why ſo late? others
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57924:214"/>ſuppoſe it of an ancienter date, but however the Church unanimouſly did aſſent to Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Farther; he ſuppoſeth the Confeſſion to be made at that juncture when they ſent <hi>Morel</hi> to <hi>Oeclampadius</hi> for Reſolution, whether they might not be preſent with their bodies at Maſs, ſo they kept their hearts right with God? This is not to the puroſe, for we gathere hence no more than this, that God's own People are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſinful fears, and are ſometimes tempted to ſin rather than to ſuffer, and that the fear of Man worketh a ſnare: all which you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the excellent Letter ſent them by <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius,</hi> p. 67, 68. of the 2d <hi>Part</hi> of our Anſwer. But all this while, what is this to take us off from believing that they were againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, which they ſay had been owned and practiſed amongſt them for ſome hundred years. This they ſcrupled not, nor ſent for any Reſolutin in the caſe; nor did they Baptize their Children out of fear of the Papiſts, who accuſed them that they were againſt it, becauſe they had in deteſtation their humane Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons added to the Sacrament, and for that reaſon delayed the Baptizing their Children until their own Paſtors came home, which were often and long abroad in Propagating the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He ſaith, <hi>Oecolampadius ſharply rebuking them</hi> [in his Letter] <hi>they thereupon promiſed to ſuit themſelves to the Documents they received from him.</hi> What they are, ſee in the aforeſaid Letter, I am ſure there is nothing of Baptiſm in it, but only
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57924:215"/>good counſel to ſtand faſt in the Truth, and keep themſelves from Idolatry: and there was a good effect of it, as appeared by their conſtant ſuffering, for perſecution came ſuddenly upon it.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>In conformity to thoſe Documents they received from him, it appears there is little or no difference between the</hi> French, <hi>and</hi> German-<hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, eſpecially thoſe that own</hi> Calvin's <hi>way, being moſt ſhrunk up into little more than a bare form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth he talk in this manner, when all the Documents they then received was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear Chriſt, and his Truth to them, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them againſt ſuffering? And what an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy is it in the Author to take occaſion from this Circumſtance to ſlur the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Proteſtants, many of whom doubtleſs have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much of the power of Godlineſs as himſelf, or as any of the <hi>Mennoniſts,</hi> or Anabaptiſts at this day in <hi>Holland,</hi> whoſe Religion we underſtand by ſome friends of theirs, is pittifully ſhrunk up to little more than the Form of <hi>Dipping,</hi> &amp; which is worſe, they ſay they be very Erroneous in more conſiderable points.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Yet more againſt them: he accuſeth them to have little of the old purity left amongſt them. And what need hath the Author to vilify them at this rate, and how impertinent is it to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince he hath undertaken. The Lord enable us to ſearch our own hearts, and we ſhall ſee cauſe enough to judg our ſelves, and not be forward in Cenſuring others: and it is to be feared the Author condemns them the more, as having little of purity becauſe they are for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57924:215"/>his Zeal is ſo much carried out about the little things of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But this, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> cannot at all weaken or enervate their old Confeſſion, Practice, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, confirmed with ſo great authority, and for ſo many Ages together. The words are good, but being applyed to a cypher, a non-entity, they become a piece of <hi>Ridicule;</hi> for there is no ſuch Confeſſion to be found, unleſs it be in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia:</hi> Nay there is nothing looks like a Confeſſion that excludes Infants from Baptiſm, as appears after all their endeavours to prodace it. See this, <hi>p.</hi> 46, 47, 48. of the 2d <hi>Part</hi> of our Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>He Profeſſeth ingenuouſly amongſt all his ſearch, that except thoſe two paſſages,</hi> (1) <hi>the Confeſſion preſented to</hi> Laodiſlaus, <hi>the 12th Article of which is for Infant-Baptiſm, and that in the Spiritual</hi> Almanack <hi>[which declares the Baptizing of their Children] he can find none.</hi> Very good: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath not gained much advantage to his cauſe; having found two Confeſſions for Infant-Baptiſm, but never one againſt it; for he muſt reckon the lying accuſations of the Papiſts, that they were againſt Baptizing Children, when they only abhorred their filthy Ceremonies, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves from the calumany, by putting forth their Confeſſions in which they Profeſs their judgment for it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Laſtly, In may little ſearch I have found an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Cnfeſſion, and ſuch a one as may ſhame the Author for his prevarication, and that is it which we have before mentioned in the 2d part of our Anſwer <hi>p.</hi> 65.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57924:221"/>not in the leaſt advantage a cauſe, but reflect ſhame upon the owners thereof; and truly our Antagoniſt hath not wanted it, thoroughout all his Diſcourſe: And there remains yet a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it in this pretence of his, that the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> were alſo againſt Infant-Baptiſm; for in all the Volumes of Hiſtory relating to this Iſland, he can find but one ſlender hint to faſten a Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (for it is no more) that the Ancient-<hi>Britains</hi> were of his ſide, and that is from a paſſage which he finds in <hi>Fabian's</hi> Cronicle which you ſhall hear by and by.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore that in the year <hi>Anno</hi> 596, <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſent from <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with near fourty more, to preach the Goſpel to the Inhabitants of this Iſland, who were then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> and as <hi>Veſtegan</hi> ſaith, without the knowledg of God ſerving, and Sacrificing unto their <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Thor, Woden, Friga:</hi> It pleaſed God to make them in a ſhort time inſtrumental to convert <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi> then King of <hi>Kent;</hi> Now after he was Baptized into the Faith of Chriſt, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company more, <hi>(Regis ad exemplum);</hi> The foreſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> with the concurrence of ſome others, as <hi>Mellitus</hi> and <hi>Juſtus,</hi> two ſent as Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors from <hi>Gregory,</hi> aſſembled and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſome of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops and Doctors who were then dwelling in-<hi>Wales,</hi> to which place the <hi>Britains</hi> had long before been driven, and there Profeſſed the Chriſtian Faith, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God in purity): In this Aſſembly <hi>Auſtin</hi> charged them that they ſhould preach with him the Word of God to the Engliſh-men, and alſo that they ſhould reform certain Rites and uſages
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57924:221"/>in their Church, ſpecially for that of keeping <hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> Baptizing after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch other like. To this the <hi>Britains</hi> would not agree, refuſing to leave the cuſtom which they ſo long had continued without the aſſent of them all which uſed the ſame. After that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> gathered another Synod, to the which came ſeven Biſhops of <hi>Britain</hi> with the wiſeſt Men of that famous Abbie of <hi>Bangor,</hi> who took offence at <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Lordly carriage, never riſing up out of his Seat, nor giving them that reſpect they looked for. <hi>Fox,</hi> Acts <hi>and</hi> Monuments 1. <hi>Book p.</hi> 154. But <hi>Fabian</hi> expreſſeth himſelf other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as the Author notes, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Then he ſaid to them, ſince you will not aſſent to my Hoſts generally, aſſent you to me eſpecially in three things. The firſt is that you keep <hi>Eaſter</hi> in due form and time as is ordained. The ſecond, that you give Chriſtendom to Children. And the third, that you preach to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as I have exhorted you; and all the other debate I ſhall ſuffer you to amend amongſt your ſelves; but, ſaith <hi>Fabian,</hi> they would not. To whom then <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, that if they would not take peace with their Brethren, they ſhould receive War with their Enemies, &amp;c. From their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal to comply with <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Propoſitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that was one the giving Chriſtendom to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Author doth confidently conclude, they were againſt Infant. Baptiſm: But that there is no ſufficient ground hence for ſuch a Concluſion will appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe no ſuch thing is mentioned by other Hiſtorians as <hi>Beda, Cretenſis in Polychron.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57924:222"/>Huntingtonenſis,</hi> which write of this matter, they ſpeak only in general. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates it, <hi>viz.</hi> of Baptizing after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> without mentioning Children.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Fabian</hi> is <hi>nigro carbone nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> lookt upon as no faithful Hiſtorian; and I find Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Martyrology,</hi> refuſe to give credit to his Relation in other things, as he doth not obſerve his words of giving Chriſtendom to Children, in the Story which he gives us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Neither do <hi>Fabian's</hi> Words import that they were any more againſt Baptizing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than Preaching of the Goſpel, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do both to the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and that poſſibly becauſe they would confine their labours to their own Dioceſs, and attend their own Flocks; or rather becauſe they would not Subject themſelves to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (for they told <hi>Auſtin</hi> to his Face they owed him no Subjection) and to the imperious command of ſuch an upſtart, proud <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> was, between whom and them there had paſſed ſome heat of words, which made them riſe in diſdain, and departed thence in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Or they might refuſe to give Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom to Children after <hi>Auſtin's</hi> mode with the corrupt Rites and Ceremonies in uſe by him. For other Hiſtorians expreſs the Injunction given that it ſhould be after the <hi>Roman</hi> Manner.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, But to put it out of all doubt that the Words of <hi>Fabian</hi> was not <hi>Auſtin's,</hi> but rather <hi>Fabian's</hi> own Paraphraſe upon them, appears by what we find in the Preface to <hi>Fabian</hi> that what he relates of this matter he hath it from <hi>Beda;</hi> if
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57924:222"/>therefore no ſuch paſſage can be found there, then we are ſure the Author is miſtaken in his Conjecture, and it is a great preſumption to lay ſuch ſtreſs upon a doubtful paſſage that may admit of ſeveral interpretations. We ſhall now give the Reader an account what <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith to the thing, <hi>viz.

And Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himſelf in <hi>pag</hi> 20. of his Anſwer ſays, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did grant the Baptizing of Infants &amp;c.

                  <p n="1">1. That Infants were born without Original ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they were Baptized not to be freed from Original ſin, but thereby to be Adopted into the Kingdom of God, as was before noted out of <hi>Auſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are yet remaining 4 or 5 trifling Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> did oppoſe the Baptizing Infants.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe they received the Chriſtian Faith, Doctrine and Diſcipline from the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>and</hi> Aſiatick-Churches, <hi>who hath no ſuch thing as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants amongſt them as you have largely heard]</hi> When the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> tell us expreſly, that it was in uſe in the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches. <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 124.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57924:226"/>that is required, excludes not the Children of Believers from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as appears by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Condition of the Perſons to whom Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to Baptize, who were <hi>Aliens,</hi> and the whole World in regard of the new-Adminiſtration were <hi>ſuch.</hi> Nor is that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. excluſive of Infants; though it requires believing to go before baptizing. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame condition that is required there, to precede Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is required to precede Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: So that if the <hi>ſence</hi> of the place be that Infants muſt not be Baptized becauſe they cannot Believe, it will as directly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low they muſt not be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot Believe.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57924:226"/>though we have no particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any Infants Baptized in this Century, yet <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> (that lived in the time of thoſe that ſaw the Apoſtles) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Infants were Baptized in the Apoſtles days. <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 496. and that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Baptizing them was tranſmitted from them to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 151.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though we have no expreſs example, yet we have ſomething <hi>Equivalent</hi> thereto. As,</p>

            <head>A Perſwaſive to UNITY amongst all that fear the Lord, though of different judgments about Baptiſm, enforced from Scripture-Arguments, and the dangerous Conſequences of Diviſions.</head>
            <p>IT is well adviſed by <hi>Jacobus Acontius,</hi> in his Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Stratagemata Sathana,</hi> that in all diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout points of Religion, this ſhould be engraven upon our hearts, <hi>That we have not to deal with the man with whom we diſpute, but with Satan himſelf; and that the main quarrel is not that point about which we argue, but ſomething of a greater concern.</hi> For the deſign of that <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious One</hi> hath been in all Ages to ſow tares of Diviſion: He it was that made the firſt <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and hath ever ſince out of an intenſe hatred to the peace and quiet of mankind ſtirred up Emulations, Wrath, Strife, and mutual Antipathies in the minds of men; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally among Chriſtians, hath he laboured to his utmoſt to foment and cheriſh <hi>Differences,</hi> to agitate <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and to rend and tear the Church of Chriſt into divers <hi>Sects</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by his notable ſubtilty and influence upon our corrupt nature, to make our very Arguings and <hi>Contendings for the Faith once delivered,</hi> too often managed with Pride, Prejudice, and carnal Intereſt, a means rather of widening than healing our Breaches. So that in our Conteſts of this nature, if we gain but a grain of <hi>Truth,</hi> we are in danger of loſing a pound of <hi>Charity.</hi> There is (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> terms it) a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>bitter Zeal,</hi> bitter indeed in its root, iſſuing from a <hi>root of bitterneſs</hi> within, and bitter in its fruits, accurſed diſcords and irreconcilable diſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Brethren. The conſideration whereof hath made me even jealous of my ſelf, leſt in the foregoing Reſponſatory-diſcourſe, any thing hath dropt from my Pen, which may tend rather to the exaſperating than convincing our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites; for 'tis hard in diſputes both not to be provoked, and not to provoke. Nevertheleſs, I hope the Godly, Sobery, and Ingenuous amongſt them, will put the beſt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all; and the rather, becauſe they cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57924:234"/>how tender I have been of them, manifeſting reſpect to ſuch throughout all the Diſcourſe: And though I contend with what I conceive is an error in them, yet I cannot but love their perſons; for I know there are ſome of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion who for their eminency in Grace, ought to be had in eſtimation by us: And I would always diſtinguiſh the Humble and Holy from the Heady and High-minded, the Tender and Conſcientious from the Turbulent and Factions of that Party. And Oh! how much do I long to ſee all rigidneſs on every ſide remov'd, and a ſweet correſpondency and complyance between God's People, though of different judgments, as to the Subject of Baptiſm. I have for more than twenty years conſidered the point, and weighed what hath been ſaid on both ſides, and cannot poſſibly be brought to judg it a matter of that moment as to break Communion, or to be proſecuted with ſo much Vehemency, as it is by ſome of the Diſſenters. 1. It being only about a point not ſo expreſly revealed, but that Godly Perſons both in Chriſt viſibly, may differ in their light about it. 2. Alſo it being only about the right or wrong application of an <hi>external Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> or <hi>Solemnity</hi> of Chriſt's Inſtitution (for Baptiſm in the outward Act of it can be eſteemed no more). Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could heartily wiſh there were a reviving of the Primitive Moderation, when Chriſtians did bear one with another, and allow a liberty in matters of an higher nature, without breach of Communion. For I verily believe, the Church of Chriſt hath received more prejudice by conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this thing than is commonly thought of; for it hath always produced heart-burnings amongſt Chriſtians, and undermined the Power of Godlineſs. And it would be more for the honour of Religion, if our Spirits were ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered and ſweetned, as to indulge each other a latitude of practice according to our light and perſwaſion, without impoſing or condemning, according to the Apoſtolical Rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Certainly the differences that are amongſt us about Baptiſm, were they put in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, to try whether they bear proportion to the diſtances and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities attending the ſame, they would be found too light. And if <hi>Auſtin</hi> did ſo much lay to heart the breach which was between two ſingle perſons, <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we have ſpoken before in our Anſwer) that he cryed out, <hi>Hei mihi qui vos alicubi ſimul invenire non
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57924:234"/>poſſum, &amp;c.</hi> Wo is me that I cannot find you both together, I would even fall down at your feet with much love, and many tears; I would beſeech you for your ſelves, and for one another, and for weak Chriſtians for whom Chriſt died, that you ſuffer not theſe diſſentions to ſpread. Oh! how much more cauſe have we to lament the breaches of ſo many thouſands of God's People, and to uſe our utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to repair the ſame. I wiſh there were more of <hi>Melancthons</hi> Spirit amongſt us, who profeſſed that though he had many domeſtical troubles, yet the publick wounds of the Church (ariſing much from the difference 'twixt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> about the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which Chriſt intended for a bond of love, as he did the other of Baptiſm) did moſt deeply afflict him. Oh! how ſad is it to behold the <hi>Staff of Beauty,</hi> and the <hi>Staff of Bands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.10, 11. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9.</note> ſo broken amongſt us. And that we cannot <hi>call upon the Lord, and ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> Thoſe were <hi>Halcyon</hi> and bleſſed days when the <hi>multitude of Believers were of one heart and one ſoul;</hi> when they held <hi>communion in Doctrine, in Fellowſhip, in breaking of Bread, and Prayer.</hi> When the People of God could hear together, and pray together, and receive together, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. When thoſe thouſands of Believers were as if they had but one heart and ſoul to animate and actuate them in God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

They ſhould no more hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than a man doth his own fleſh; And <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite</hi> calls the Godly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, perſons cloſely compacted into One, according as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. where he ſpeaks of the Body's being compacted. For they ſhould be as the Pearl, which is united in it ſelf, and is called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nio. He that is joyned to the Lord,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, <hi>is one Spirit, One Spirit in himſelf, One with God,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57924:235"/>and One with all his People.</hi> In order to this bleſſed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Accommodation of the Godly, I ſhall in all humility addreſs my ſelf to both Parties, to them who are for, and to them that are againſt Infant-Baptiſm. 1. To the <hi>Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers</hi> in general. 2. To the <hi>Antipoedobaptiſts</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the firſt of theſe, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that fear God, I can with great confidence expect to meet with better meaſure from them, than to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an overweening conceit of my own ſufficiency to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Work of a <hi>Conciliator;</hi> I only humbly ſubmit what I have to ſay to their judicious &amp; godly Conſideration, Whether it be not their duty to entertain and keep up Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and Communion in all other Ordinances wherein they are agreed, notwithſtanding this their difference about Baptiſm? which to me ſeems clear for ſeveral Reaſons; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are Members of the ſame Body, of which Chriſt is the Head. Rom. 12.4, 5. <hi>We being many, are one body in Chriſt, and every one Members of another,</hi>— the import of which is, that all Believers ſtand to Chriſt in the ſame relation that the natural Body doth ſtand to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Head, and that they all ſtand in relation one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Members of the natural Body do ſtand one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. To the ſame purpoſe is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. where from the 4th to the 7th verſe, the Apoſtle ſhews, That there are diverſities of Gifts, and differences of Adminiſtrations, and diverſities of Operations; but all come from the ſame Spirit, Lord and God, and are given for this end, that they may be for the profiting of the whole. And that we might more plainly apprehend him, he further tells us, that as in the natural Body there are divers Members joined, and each Member hath its ſeveral office for the good of all; ſo is Chriſt, ſaith he, that is, Chriſt collectively and myſtically, Chriſt and all his Members: and then he adds, verſ. 13. <hi>That by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtum intellige cum Eccleſia ſuâ conjunctim, et qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenùs est corporis myſtici caput. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in loc.</note> 
               <hi>whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, bond or free;</hi> which cannot be meant of Water-Baptiſm, ſaith Mr. <hi>Jeſſe</hi> (an eminent godly <hi>Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>) in regard all the Body of Chriſt, Jews and Gentiles, bond and free, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took not of that Sacrament of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the Goſpel-Adminiſtration) <hi>and are made to drink into the ſame Spirit;</hi> which is alſo to be underſtood metaphorically and ſpiritually, <hi>Potionati ſumus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:57924:235"/>and ſo prove our ſelves to be of one and the ſame Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of Believers. Like to this is that <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. from whom the whole Body fitly joyned and compacted together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From what hath been ſaid there follow theſe five Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Body</hi> in the Church floweth from Unity to the Head; firſt, the Members are united to the <hi>Head,</hi> and then to <hi>one another,</hi> and with the <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Spiritual Union and Conjunction with the Lord Jeſus, is the foundation of all their Communion with one another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As in the Natural Body, all the Members do not only meet in the Head, as the Lines in the Center, but have real Union one with another; ſo in this Myſtical and Spiritual <hi>Body,</hi> all <hi>Believers</hi> have not only each for his own part Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Conjunction with Chriſt, but alſo a real Union and Conjunction with each other, which is the ground of all offices of Love, and reciprocal Fellowſhip and Communion, wherein they ſtand obliged amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Union to the <hi>whole,</hi> the Catholick or Univerſal Church or Body of Chriſt, gives right to Communion with any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of Chriſt in the World; and there is no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever (as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> obſerves) in any part of the World, but where-ever he comes, might demand, upon the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Faith, and his voluntary ſubjection to the Goſpel, his right in the Ordinances, to hear, and pray, and receive the Sacrament with them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To deny Communion to any who give evidence that they are of the ſame Body, is to be guilty of a great <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Body, and moſt oppoſit to the deſign of God's Grace, in compacting all his People into one Body; which was,
<list>
                  <item>1. That there ſhould be no Schiſm in the Body.</item>
                  <item>2. That therefore the Members ſhould have the like care of one another.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>They therefore who in contrariety hereto ſtand at a diſtance one from another, and refuſe Communion, do that which is not practicable from Scripture: for it is unnatural and deſtructive to the Body, and not only ſo, but fouly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the Chriſtian Religion: for, as the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Lord Bacon's Eſſayes.</note> like a Divine as well as a Philoſopher, Schiſm is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Scandals, yea more than corruption of Manners: For, as in the Natural Body, a Wound or Solution
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57924:236"/>of Continuity is worſe than a Corrupt Humour, ſo in the Spiritual: So that nothing doth ſo much keep men out of the Church, and drive men out of the Church as breach of Unity. This then is the firſt Argument, they are both viſibly Members of Chriſt's Body, and therefore ſhould have Communion one with another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe both parties agree in the main <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Religion; and Union in the great things of Religion ſhould oblige them to bear with one another in leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Phil. 3.15, 16. <hi>If in any things ye be otherwiſe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God ſhall reveal even that to you: Nevertheleſs, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</hi> Here's an excellent direction to preſerve Unity amongſt God's People, notwithſtanding difference in judgment, and for compoſing and healing of differences when they ariſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſtians are to conſider whereunto they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained, and how far they do agree, Whether there be not a mutual Conſent in the Principles and Fundamentals of Religion; for, if this be wanting, all Union is but a daubing with untempeted mortar, and a Conſpiracy againſt Chriſt: but when there is a Conſent in Fundamentals, and the Marks of Godlineſs upon Perſons, Wiſdom and Charity ſhould teach us to condeſcend unto, and forbear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but alas, how much is this wanting! may we not ſigh out that doleful ſentence, <hi>Heu pro quantillo pacem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didimus!</hi> for what poor inconſiderable things do we jar and differ!</p>
            <p n="2">2. To walk by the ſame Rule, or to put in practice thoſe Truths wherein they do agree. They agree in Prayer, in Hearing, in the Lord's Supper, let them walk together in theſe. The beſt way to attain Unity in Judgment, is to maintain it in Obedience, and jointly to walk together in the Ordinances and Duties wherein Chriſtians do agree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To mind the ſame thing; that is, I conceive, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame ends in Religion. Nothing cauſeth more difference than poor, narrow, ſelfiſh-ends. If Profeſſors had all one common end, <hi>viz.</hi> to be really Godly, and to advance the Glory of God in the World, there would be an end of theſe bickerings. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath an eye to this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. There he uſeth moſt pathetical Arguments to Love and Union; and for to further it, he preſſeth the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to be <hi>like-minded,</hi> and <hi>let nothing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be done
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57924:236"/>through ſtrife or vain-glory.</hi> v. 2, 3. and in the 4th vers — <hi>look not every man at his own things, &amp;c.</hi> that is, at his own Intereſt, Honour, Party, &amp;c. Were we better United in our ends and aims, and did jointly level at God's Glory, and Chriſt's Intereſt in the advancement of piety, we ſhould quickly agree in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe we are Commanded not to refuſe Chriſtian Communion, though the difference be in far greater matters than this of Baptiſm. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith receive you</hi> &amp;c. By Faith is meant the Doctrine of Faith, as <hi>Beza</hi> notes on the place. Him that is weak, and ſo weak,<note place="margin">Fides hoc in loco declarat Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ipſam Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam in qua ſit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis rudis, ac pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde diſcrimen Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum &amp; Dierum nondum intelligat Chriſti beneficio fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe ſublatum.</note> as not to diſcern that by Chriſt's coming the difference of days and meats was taken away. There was it ſeems a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongſt them, and ſome were more thorowly inſtructed in the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Chriſtian Liberty, as touching the ceſſation of legal Ceremonies, who held all days alike, and all meats in themſelves indifferent; whereas others being not well informed, obſerved ſtill a difference both of meats, accounting them clean or unclean, and of days accounting them holy or ſervile, according as they ſtood in under the Levitical-Law. This cauſed no little ſtir and trouble amongſt them—Now the courſe the Apoſtle takes to heal theſe breaches is worth obſerving: He doth not caſt the Ballance to one ſide, requiring the other to come up to their Practice, but exhorts them to allow a Latitude; and not only for Opinions, but Practices, and to forbear one another in love, and not to cenſure and condemn thoſe that differ from them. Seeing the Men of contrary Perſwaſions in leſſer matters may yet agree in the main fundamentals; and the reaſon why the ſtronger ſhould receive the weaker, is, becauſe God had received him, that is, into Communion with himſelf. We have the ſame urged again <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, receive ye one another as Chriſt alſo hath received us:</hi> by all which it appears that no ſuppoſed or real error can be a reaſon why others ſhould not be received to Communion, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it is a reaſon to prove that the Lord hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them; &amp; the concluſion is that let the Error be where 'twill, either on the <hi>Paedobaptiſt's or Antipaedobaptiſt's</hi> ſide, it is all one, if God and Chriſt have received theſe of both
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57924:237"/>Perſwaſions into Communion with himſelf, they break the Command, if they refuſe to receive one another into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is that Command of the Apoſtle, <hi>to follow after ſuch things as make for Peace, and mutual Edification.</hi> Rom. 14.19. The Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, let us eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after it as the Hunter doth his Prey; and it denotes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we are not barely to deſire it, or accept of any reaſonable terms that are propoſed for accommodation and agreement, but we are to purſue and go after it, if by any means we may overtake it, or apprehend it. The ſame duty is preſt; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3. where the Exhortation is <hi>to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bound of Peace;</hi> the Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies a moſt earneſt ſtudying which way it may be effected: <hi>Ita alicui rei ſtudere, ut ad eam omni impetu feraris, &amp; approperes;</hi> to be ſo intent upon a thing, as to further it with might and main as we uſe to ſay. The Gramarians oppoſe this Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>Inconſiderate, Perfunctorie, &amp; extempore aliquid agere;</hi> to do a thing careleſly; but this in the Text ſignifies <hi>Diligenter, &amp; intent â cogitatione efficere;</hi> to be diligent and very thoughtful how to accompliſh a thing, and it points out this, that we ought on all hands to uſe a ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous endeavour to preſerve the Unity of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It denotes unwearied patience in the purſuit after it, notwithſtanding all diſappointments and diſcouragements met with in our attempts after it. We ought not to give over, but perſevere in ſo good a Work. I like not that ſpeech of <hi>Hornbeck</hi> Summa <hi>Controv.</hi> L. 9. <hi>de Luther.</hi> who ſaith, The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> had done too much in overtures for a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> much leſs can I approve of ſuch who by word and writing endeavour to widen breaches, and ſet Chriſtians at farther diſtances. Certainly the <hi>Pride, Conceit,</hi> and <hi>Diſcontent</hi> of ſome ſpirits have done much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief this way: and to ſpeak plainly the inconſiderableneſs of our differences, and inconſiderateneſs wherewith it is purſued, argues that much of the Zeal of the Diſſenters, is not, as one ſays, that holy fire which is kindled by a Coal from the Altar, but rather an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> that leads men quite out of God's Way; or a Wild Fire that rends and tears where it goes. Now in aſmuch as nothing hinders endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours like to deſpair, and all <hi>Eſſays</hi> for Union hitherto have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57924:237"/>proved ſucceſleſs, and there are few to be found of healing, and peaceable Spirits, but much of Pride, humor, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedneſs appears every-where, even in thoſe that we cannot but think are good Men in them main; we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if we look no farther than our ſelves, that the differences amongſt us will never be compoſed. But we are to look higher than our ſelves, and for the erecting of our hopes and quickning our endeavours after it; we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath prayed that all Believers may be one, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. and he was heard in all that he prayed for. That they All may be one, (All) of them there is, the Univerſal Extent of it; One in Affection, and not only ſo, but alſo One in Worſhip, and Communion and Ordinances, although there may be variety of Opinions amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath promiſed to bring this about. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way.</hi> And in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They ſhall call upon the name of the Lord and ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> the Word in the Original is <hi>one Shoulder.</hi> They ſhall all of them have as it were but one Shoulder, that they ſhall ſet to the ſervice of God. And <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1.11. <hi>Then ſhall the Children of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be gathered together;</hi> Here (ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>) we have a Promiſe both to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together; great was their Enmity, heretofore they Worſhipped the ſame God, though in a diverſe manner, <hi>Judah</hi> keeping cloſe to God's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> not. There was a great deal of bitterneſs between them, though Worſhipping the ſame God. But God hath promiſed they ſhall be gathered together, upon which he raiſeth two Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there ſhall be Union between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Here's a mercy, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> a wonderful work of God! Many times between ſuch as profeſs the ſame Religion, and ſeem not to differ much, and yet to differ; their Oppoſitions are moſt bitter and irreconcilable, and requires a mighty Work of God to bring them in and Reconcile them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath a time, [there is a ſet time appointed] to gather <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> both together, that is, to bring Peace to his Church; God hath a time to gather all his Church together in a way of Peace, that there ſhall be a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57924:238"/>Univerſal Peace amongſt his Churches; for though 'tis true it be meant here of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> literally, yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> is to ſet out to us all the Churches of Chriſt, that ſhall be afterward amongſt the Gentiles So that <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall not envy <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall not envy <hi>Ephraim. Iſa.</hi> 11. 13. The <hi>envy of</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſhall depart.</hi> God will take away this Envious, Vexatious Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it be conſidered that we (upon whom the ends of the Earth are come) live nearer the accompliſhment of theſe Promiſes than the former generations: yea,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The day of their fulfilling begins to dawn, the Spirits of many excellent Chriſtians incline, and work towards U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; yea ſome are actually in Union and Communion in all other Ordinances, though they differ in the point of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: they are come off from their former rigidneſs, and can hear and pray, and receive together in divers places of this Nation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Light increaſeth more and more, whereby they ſee what is the right <hi>Baſis,</hi> and ground of Communion; That it is for grace-ſake and not a <hi>Syncretiſm,</hi> or agreement in Opinions, That Chriſtians ſhould love and imbrace one another; and that heart-Religion, and Godlineſs is to be preferred before Notions and Forms.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They do alſo ſee the diſmal and fatal conſequences of their Diviſions, and thoſe who are wiſe and ſolid, muſt needs on that account be ſtudious of Accommodation: they do now experimentally find that it is this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſtrengthens the hands of the common Enemies of Religion, <hi>Divide &amp; impera;</hi> Diſſolution is the Daughter of Diviſion: It is even Nuts to the common Enemy to ſee how God's People wrangle and divide: they may well conclude that though they are quiet and let them alone, deſtruction will ariſe out of themſelves; they may fit ſtill, and laugh and ſay, Aha ſo would we have it. And as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, if ey bite and devoure one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one of another. This is like to be the <hi>finis operis</hi> though not <hi>operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This alſo opens the Mouths of Men to Blaſpheme, and ſpeak evil of the good ways of God. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> (that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting

               <hi>Roman Emperour</hi> lookt upon the Chriſtian Religion as a wretched device of wicked Men, and that becauſe of the pride and diſſentions he obſerv'd amongſt the Paſtors and Biſhops; ſo now adays ſome <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and time-ſervers ſet their Wits on work to vilify the pure Worſhip of God, and to bring the power of Godlineſs into contempt, and the main Topic from whence they fetch their Helliſh Arguments is the Diviſions and Diſſentions of Profeſſors. There be ſome of late have been notable Factors for Hell, and would deride and jeer Men out of ſtrictneſs and purity; and not a few Books of this kind have been printed whoſe deſign have been meerly to diſcountenance Religion, and the Authors of them have done as much for the Devil this way, that he can hardly tell what to deſire more of them; and 'tis to be feared he will pay them their wages ſhortly: And verily the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God's People have occaſioned much of theſe mens Blaſphemies, it hath been a woful ſtumbling Block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 It is that which in all likelyhood will draw perſecution upon all their heads at laſt; they fear it, and they need it, and it is juſt with God to bring it upon them.<note place="margin">Remarkable is that ſaying of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, viz. non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſent Fratribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57924:239"/>gives them up into the hands of their Enemies <hi>ad abſtergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum aeruginem,</hi> to ſcour off their ruſt as he phraſeth it. And Mr. <hi>Burroughs ut ſupra</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Hoſea</hi> Chap. 3. ſaith, God may juſtly give us over into the hands of our Enemies, if we agree not among our ſelves, and they may Chain us together: perhaps a Priſon may make us agree, as it was ſaid of <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> though <hi>Ridley</hi> ſtood much againſt <hi>Hooper</hi> in point of Ceremonies, and they could not agree, yet when they came to Priſon they did well enough there; the Lord deliver us, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> from that Medicine of our diſſentions, that we be not made ſo to agree, yea that we be not ſodered together with our own blood.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, There is one thing yet behind, and that is to apply my ſelf more particularly to thoſe who are <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> that fear the Lord in this Nation, and let it be reſented, as offered to them in all love and humility. There are a few things I would leave with them by way of Caution. The Lord knows I deſire not to ſcatter in <hi>Iſrael</hi> nor to divide in <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed leſt your Zeal for your own way, which you take to be moſt agreeable to Truth, doth eat up your love to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with the Godly,<note place="margin">Cautions <hi>to the</hi> Antipaedobaptiſts.</note> who are otherwiſe minded; The Apoſtle Exhors us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ſpeak the Truth in love, to truthify it in love, as Mr. <hi>Crook</hi> tranſlates it, aiming to reach the fulneſs of the Greek in one Word. So 'tis your duty (if your opinion be true as we ſuppoſe it is not) to manage your Tenents with love, meekneſs and moderation of Spirit towards thoſe who are otherwiſe minded, and yet agree with you in other things: For though every Truth be precious, yet every Truth is not neceſſary to Salvation, nor to be found in all, with whom notwithſtanding it may be neceſſary for you to hold Communion; and that becauſe you cannot but know that many Paedobaptiſts are as Godly as your ſelves, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in Chriſt Jeſus and called to be Saints. 2. In not doing ſo, you deprive your ſelves of the benefit of their Gifts and Graces, and of that help which you might have from many eminent Miniſters of Chriſt; and that aſſiſtance for Converſion of Souls and Edification, which in ſome of your Meetings you very much want; and when thoſe that are able of your way ſhall be removed by death, you are like to be ſtraitned for want of Men, of competent and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57924:239"/>fitting parts for the carrying on the work of the Miniſtry, as it ought to be done amongſt your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beware of Pride; for where this is predominant, it will not ſuffer men to recede from thoſe rigid Principles and Practices they have taken up. As Pride makes men unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive the Truth from others, ſo it will keep them from retracting an Error, though convinced thereof. <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſed to <hi>Melancthon</hi> before his death, that he would have retracted many things, (eſpecially in thoſe Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Controverſies) but that he feared it would leſſen the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Works. So much of <hi>Pope</hi> hath every man in his own breaſt, as to affect to be thought <hi>infallible, malunt ſemper errare quam ſemel erraſſe videri;</hi> they had rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways err, than ſeem once to have erred. But what-ever a man may loſe in reputation of knowledg, he ſhall be ſure to gain in eſtimation of candour, ingenuity, and ſincerity. <hi>Auſtin</hi> got aſmuch eſteem by his Book of Retractations, as by any other of his works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed of a <hi>Cenſorious judging-Spirit:</hi> do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe that cloſe not in with you to act againſt their light. It is a very uncharitable paſſage which I find in Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Praecurſor</hi> pag. 91. Unleſs, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> I ſpeak againſt my conſcience, I muſt needs ſay, that it is ignorance or wilfulneſs, holds Miniſters and People in their ſtiff aſſerting &amp; Practice of Infant-Baptiſm. But what it was that kept him ſo long in the practice of it, in his Pariſh-Churches before the Aſſembly of Divines ſate, is beſt known to the ſearcher of hearts; &amp; yet this very man 17 lines above in the ſame page, hath that which amounts to ſelf-contradiction, viz. <hi>That he reverenceth many Paedobaptiſts as Godly Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel far beyond himſelf.</hi> The Lord baniſh from among you this Cenſorious ſpirit, unto which ſome of you have been too much addicted. How often have we been araigned at your bar for ſinning againſt light, for Obſtinacy and Wilfulneſs? &amp; your Cenſures have lighted moſt heavily upon Miniſters, ſparing none, neither <hi>Conformiſts</hi> nor <hi>Non-conformiſts.</hi> Heretofore 'twas wordly Intereſt, Parochial Maintenance, and fear of diſpleaſing the people that blinded and corrupted them (a hard Cenſure to be paſt upon the whole body of the Miniſtry of the <hi>Nation</hi>) and how could it conſiſt with Godlineſs for them to perſiſt ſo many years in the Practice of that which they thought in their own conſciences to be but a meer <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Innovation.</hi> But you have lived
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57924:240"/>to ſee your miſtake herein; and tell us now (if you can) what the temptations are that blind the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> ſince their <hi>Ejection,</hi> and keeps them from coming over to you? They were in number (as they ſay) about 3000. and I think you cannot ſhew us a Catalogue of one in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no not in ten Counties, that is proſelyted to you. God by his inſcrutable and wiſe Providence, hath found out a ſtrange way to clear the innocency of his Servants, that were ſo often branded for <hi>Hirelings,</hi> and there hath been an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſe taken to clear their eye-ſight, had Wordly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt blinded them: They are now out of the reach of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances on that account.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I would alſo humbly adviſe you to take heed of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Principles, that are inconſiſtent with the Word, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this Circumſtance of the Church wherein we are in danger to be overwhelmed with other difficulties: if it were tolerable, and venial to divide at other times, yet now the fault is irremiſſible and irrational. <hi>Luther</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Norimberg</hi> to ſilence the Diſputes until a fitter oportunity; <hi>Meum Conſilium eſt, ut cauſam hanc ſinatis ad tempus ſopitam jacere, hoc tempore enim &amp; animis ſic affestis, venenum eſt diſputare.</hi> I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel you that in this juncture of time, and when your minds are ſo much out of tune, you would let this Controverſy ſleep, and not diſpute about it, for it will prove poyſonous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take heed of rejecting thoſe Overtures for Union, which are made by your Brethren. We are commanded to follow after thoſe things that make for Peace, and ſhall we run away from them? You ſay they differ from you, and do not you likewiſe from them? We all ſee but in part, and know but in part, and therefore ſhould bear with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Why ſhould you not have the like freedom which your Brethren have? Their Arms are open to receive you. You are ſtraitned in your own Bowels, and not in theirs. O why will you not imbrace where Chriſt imbraceth? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe whom God receiveth? Or why do you refuſe Communion with thoſe here in Ordinances that you have ground to believe you ſhall have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with in Glory.<note place="margin">Perſwaſive to Peace.</note> If you ſay, becauſe they are not Baptized after Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: This can be no more neceſſary for Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than it is unto Salvation; for the means cannot be more neceſſary to the ſubordinat end, which is Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57924:240"/>than it is to the Principal which is Salvation And Baptiſm is neceſſary to Salvation but by way of duty where opportunity concurs, but not by way of means where opportunity is wanting. And if to be Baptized after Faith, were indeed the Paedobaptiſts duty, the true reaſon why they do not perform it, is the want of a <hi>Moral</hi> opportunity, that is, the want of Conviction that it is their duty, they verily believing they were ſufficiently Baptized in their Infancy: and that it is not lawful for them to be rebaptized. And all the while they remain under this perſwaſion, they can no more lawfully receive an after-Baptizing, by a voluntary ſubmiſſion to it, than they can who deſire to be Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but want the opportunity of health or ſuch an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator (as you call it) as is neceſſary thereto. And if their Right to Salvation under theſe Circumſtances, be not cut off, as doubtleſs it is not for the reaſon before given, then no more can their Right to Church-Communion thereby be cut off for the ſame reaſon. To conclude, let us all pray for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that our Father which is in Heaven, the God of Peace, would look down upon his Divided Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and create Peace among them; That Chriſt Jeſus who is the Peace-maker, and Prince of Peace, that prayed for it, and bequeathed it to his Diſciples as his laſt Legacy, would reconcile our hearts one to another: That the Spirit of Peace whoſe fruit is Peace would compoſe our differences and make up our breaches, and give us enlarged hearts to embrace each other: That the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> which hath nothing ſo proper to it ſelf as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> would pitty <hi>Zion,</hi> and raiſe up healing Inſtruments, and rebuke fiery Spirits, and remember the Promiſe that is made to the Church to be fulfilled in the times of the Goſpel, That all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace of her Children.</p>
